    "text":"Related UAS Integration Initiatives While this rulemaking was pending,the FAA recognized that there already exists a population of small UAS operators and remote pilots who are ready and able to operate safely. To address the needs of these operators and remote pilots while these regulations were being finalized, the Department issued thousands of exemptions under its section 333 authority to permit civil visual-line-of-sight small UAS operations in the NAS.21 The operations permitted under those exemptions are similar to those that will be enabled by part 107. In addition, to further facilitate the integration of UAS into the NAS, the FAA has chosen six UAS research and test site operators across the country. In selecting the six test site operators, the FAA considered geography, climate, location of ground infrastructure, research needs, airspace use, safety, aviation experience, and risk. In totality, these six test site applications achieve cross-country geographic and climatic diversity and help the FAA meet its UAS research needs. As of December 2015, all of the UAS test sites are operational and are gathering operational data to foster further integration, as well as evaluating new technologies. The FAA has also selected, after a rigorous competition, a Mississippi State University team as the FAA’s Center of Excellence for Unmanned Aircraft Systems. The Center of Excellence will focus on research, education, and training in areas critical to safe and successful integration of UAS into the NAS.22 In May 2015, the FAA announced the UAS Focus Area Pathfinders initiative,23 a partnership with industry to explore the next steps in unmanned aircraft operations beyond the type of operations the agency proposed in the small UAS NPRM. Three companies reached out to the FAA to work on research to continue expanding use of UAS in the nation’s airspace in three focus areas: Visual line-of-sight operations in urban areas; extended visual-line-of-sight operations in rural areas; and beyond visual line-of-sight in rural/isolated areas. In October 2015 a fourth Pathfinder initiative was added, testing technology to identify small UAS operating around airports. In September 2015, the FAA issued Advisory Circular 91–57A,24 Model Aircraft Operating Standards, replacing and superseding the guidance provided in the now-cancelled Advisory Circular 91–57, issued in 1981. The updated document provides guidance to persons operating unmanned aircraft for hobby or recreation purposes meeting the statutory definition of ‘‘model aircraft’’ contained in Section 336 of the FAA Modernization and Reform Act (Public Law 112–95), and describes means by which model aircraft may be operated safely in the NAS. In February 2016, the FAA convened an aviation rulemaking committee (ARC) to provide recommendations for a performance-based standard that would allow certain UAS to be operated over people. Previously characterized as micro UAS in the NPRM for this final rule, this category of operations will now be considered in a separate rulemaking.

",
    "text":"Small UAS operations pose risk considerations that are different from the risk considerations typically associated with manned-aircraft operations. On one hand, certain operations of a small unmanned aircraft, discussed more fully in section III.E of this preamble, have the potential to pose significantly less risk to persons and property than comparable operations of a manned aircraft due to differences in the weight of the aircraft. The typical total takeoff weight of a general aviation aircraft is between 1,300 and 6,000 pounds as compared to a total takeoff weight of a small unmanned aircraft of less than 55 pounds. Consequently, because of the reduced weight, the small unmanned aircraft would pose significantly less risk to persons and property on the ground in the event of a mishap or pilot error. As such, a small UAS operation whose parameters are well defined to mitigate risk to other aircraft would also pose a smaller overall public risk or threat to national security than the operation of a manned aircraft. On the other hand, even though small UAS operations have the potential to pose a lower level of public risk in certain types of operations, the unmanned nature of the small UAS operations raises two unique safety concerns that are not present in manned-aircraft operations. The first safety concern is whether the person operating the small unmanned aircraft, who is physically separated from that aircraft during flight, would have the ability to see manned aircraft in the air in time to prevent a mid-air collision with that manned aircraft. As discussed in more detail below, the FAA’s regulations currently require each person operating an aircraft to maintain vigilance ‘‘so as to see and avoid other aircraft.’’ 8 This is one of the fundamental principles for collision avoidance in the NAS. For manned-aircraft operations, ‘‘see and avoid’’ is the responsibility of pilots on board an aircraft. Because the remote pilot in an unmanned aircraft operation is not physically on the unmanned aircraft, that remote pilot does not have the same visual perspective and ability to see other aircraft as a manned-aircraft pilot. Thus, the challenge for small unmanned aircraft operations is to ensure that the person operating the small unmanned aircraft is able to see and avoid other aircraft. The second safety concern with small UAS operations is the possibility that, during flight, the person piloting the small unmanned aircraft may lose control of the aircraft due to a failure of the control link between the aircraft and the remote pilot’s control station. This is known as a loss of positive control and may result from a system failure or because the aircraft has been flown beyond the signal range or in an area where control link communication between the aircraft and the control station is interrupted. A small unmanned aircraft whose flight is unable to be directly controlled could pose a significant risk to persons, property, or other aircraft. "

    "text":"Due to the lack of an onboard pilot small UAS operations cannot be conducted in accordance with many of the FAAs current operating regulations codified in 14 CFR part 91 that apply to general aviation The primary example of this conflict is 91113b which requires each person operating an aircraft to maintain vigilance so as to see and avoid other aircraft The FAA created this requirement in a 1968 rulemaking9 which combined two previous aviation regulatory provisions Civil Air Regulations CAR 6013c and 6030 into the see and avoid requirement now found in 91113b These CAR provisions were intended to address aircraft collisionawareness problems by requiring a pilot on board the aircraft to look out of the aircraft during flight to observe whether other aircraft are on a collision path with his or her aircraft Those provisions did not contemplate the use of technology to substitute for the human vision of a pilot on board the aircraft nor did they contemplate the manipulation of the aircraft from outside of the aircraft To the contrary CAR 6013c stated that one of the problems it intended to address was preoccupation by the pilot with cockpit duties which indicates that the regulation contemplated the presence of a pilot on board the aircraft Based on this intent 91113b requires an aircraft pilot to have the perspective of being inside the aircraft as that aircraft is moving in order to see and avoid other aircraft Since the remote pilot of a small UAS does not have this perspective operation of a small UAS cannot meet the see and avoid requirement of 91113b In addition to regulatory considerations there are statutory considerations that apply to small UAS operations For example even though a small UAS is different from a manned aircraft the operation of a small UAS still involves the operation of an aircraft under the FAAs statute which defines an aircraft as any contrivance invented used or designed to navigate or fly in the air 49 USC 40102a6 Congress reaffirmed that an unmanned aircraft is an aircraft in the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 by defining unmanned aircraft as an aircraft that is operated without the possibility of direct human intervention from within or on the aircraft Sec 3318 Public Law 11295 In Administrator v Pirker the National Transportation Safety Board NTSB unanimously affirmed this understanding finding that an unmanned aircraft is an aircraft for purposes of the FAAs statutes and regulations10 Because a small UAS involves the operation of an aircraft this triggers the FAAs registration and certification statutory requirements Specifically subject to certain exceptions a person may not operate a civil aircraft that is not registered 49 USC 44101a In addition a person may not operate a civil aircraft in air commerce without an airworthiness certificate 49 USC 44711a1 Finally a person may not serve in any capacity as an airman on a civil aircraft being operated in air commerce without an airman certificate 49 USC 44711a2A11 The term air commerce as used in the FAAs statutes is defined broadly to include the operation of aircraft within the limits of a Federal airway or the operation of aircraft that directly affects or may endanger safety in foreign or interstate air commerce 49 USC 40102a3 Because of this broad definition the NTSB has held that any use of an aircraft for purpose of flight constitutes air commerce 12 Courts that have considered this issue have reached similar conclusions that air commerce as defined in the FAAs statute encompasses a broad range of commercial and noncommercial aircraft operations13 Accordingly because air commerce encompasses such a broad range of aircraft operations a civil small unmanned aircraft cannot currently be operated for purposes of flight if it does not comply with the above statutes However the FAAs current processes for issuing airworthiness and airman certificates were designed to be used for manned aircraft and do not take into account the considerations associated with civil small UAS Because the pertinent existing regulations do not differentiate between manned and unmanned aircraft a small UAS is currently subject to the same airworthiness certification process as a manned aircraft These existing regulations do not contemplate small UAS operations that could as a result of their operational parameters safely be conducted without any airworthiness certification This framework imposes an undue burden on such operations Additionally under current pilot certification regulations depending on the type of operation the remote pilot in command of the small UAS currently must obtain a sport recreation private commercial or airline transport pilot certificate While a private pilot and commercial pilot may both operate an aircraft for the furtherance of a business a private pilot may only do so if the flight is incidental to the pilots business or employment and not for compensation or hire Only a commercial or airline transport pilot certificate may be used to operate an aircraft for compensation or hire14 Typically to obtain a sport private recreational commercial or airline transport pilot certificate the small UAS pilot currently has to 1 Receive training in specific aeronautical knowledge areas 2 receive training from an authorized instructor on specific areas of aircraft operation and 3 pass an aeronautical knowledge test and a practical skills test A certificate applicant also has to obtain minimum hours of flight time prior to applying for the certificate 1 20 hours for a sport pilot certificate 2 30 hours for a recreational pilot certificate 3 40 hours for a private pilot certificate 4 250 hours for a commercial pilot certificate and 5 1500 hours for an airline transport pilot certificate Finally the certificate applicant has to establish his or her physical capability by 1 Holding a valid and effective drivers license for a sport pilot certificate 2 obtaining a thirdclass airman medical certificate for a recreational or private pilot certificate 3 obtaining a secondclass airman medical certificate for a commercial pilot certificate or to exercise secondincommand privileges of an airline transport pilot certificate or 4 obtaining a firstclass airman medical certificate to exercise pilotincommand privileges of an airline transport pilot certificate While these airman certification requirements are necessary for manned aircraft operations they impose an unnecessary burden for many small UAS pilots because a person obtains a pilot certificate under part 61 by learning how to operate a manned aircraft Much of that aeronautical experienceflight training is not applicable to small UAS operations because a small UAS is operated differently than a manned aircraft In addition the aeronauticalflight experience currently necessary to obtain a pilot certificate under part 61 does not equip the certificate holder with all of the tools necessary to safely pilot a small UAS Specifically applicants for a pilot certificate under part 61 currently are not trained in how to deal with those aspects of seeandavoid and lossofpositivecontrol safety issues that are unique to small unmanned aircraft Thus requiring persons wishing to operate a small UAS to obtain a pilot certificate under part 61 imposes the cost of airman certification on those persons but does not result in a significant safety benefit because the process of obtaining the certificate does not equip those persons with all of the tools necessary to mitigate the public risk posed by small UAS operations"

    "text":"To address the issues discussed above, the Department has been engaged in a rulemaking to integrate small UAS into the NAS.15 In 2012, Congress passed the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 (Pub. L. 112–95). In section 332(b) of Public Law 112–95, Congress directed the Secretary to issue a final rule on small unmanned aircraft systems that will allow for civil operations of such systems in the NAS.16 In section 333 of Public Law 112–95, Congress also directed the Secretary to determine whether ‘‘certain unmanned aircraft systems may operate safely in the national airspace system.’’ To make a determination under section 333, the Secretary of Transportation must assess ‘‘which types of unmanned aircraft systems, if any, as a result of their size, weight, speed, operational capability, proximity to airports and populated areas, and operation within visual line of sight do not create a hazard to users of the national airspace system or the public or pose a threat to national security.’’ Public Law 112–95, Sec. 333(b)(1). The Secretary must also determine whether a certificate of waiver or authorization, or airworthiness certification is necessary to mitigate the public risk posed by the unmanned aircraft systems that are under consideration. Public Law 112– 95, Sec. 333(b)(2). If the Secretary determines that certain unmanned aircraft systems may operate safely in the NAS, then the Secretary must ‘‘establish requirements for the safe operation of such aircraft systems in the national airspace system.’’ Public Law 112–95, Sec. 333(c). The flexibility provided for in section 333 did not extend to airman certification and security vetting, aircraft marking, or registration requirements. As discussed previously, the FAA’s statute normally requires an aircraft being flown outdoors to possess an airworthiness certificate.17 However, subsection 333(b)(2) allows for the determination that airworthiness certification is not necessary for certain small UAS. The key determinations that must be made in order for UAS to operate under the authority of section 333 are: (1) The operation must not create a hazard to users of the national airspace system or the public; and (2) the operation must not pose a threat to national security.18 In making these determinations, the Secretary of Transportation must consider the following factors: size, weight, speed, operational capability, proximity to airports and populated areas, and operation within visual line of sight. In 2013, the Department issued a comprehensive plan and subsequently the FAA issued a roadmap of its efforts to achieve safe integration of UAS operations into the NAS.19 As a result of its ongoing integration efforts, the FAA seeks to change its regulations to take the first step in the process of integrating small UAS operations into the NAS. The NPRM proposed to utilize the airworthiness-certification flexibility provided by Congress in section 333 of Public Law 112–95, and allow some small UAS operations to commence in the NAS.20 As noted earlier in this executive summary, the FAA published the NPRM on February 23, 2015, and received over 4,600 comments. The NPRM proposed to issue small UAS airman certificates to applicants who passed a knowledge test, and proposed to allow line-of-sight operations of small unmanned aircraft below 500 feet AGL at speeds of less than 100 miles per hour. Airworthiness certification would not be required under the proposed rule. The FAA has considered the public comments filed in response to the NPRM, and now issues this final rule."

As such, the FAA invited comment as to whether the final rule should include some type of waiver authority (such as a letter of deviation or a waiver) to better accommodate these new technologies. For the reasons discussed below, the FAA has decided to proceed with an incremental approach in this final rule but has added waiver authority to the regulatory text in order to accommodate new technologies and unique operational circumstances. A number of commenters, including NTSB, Airlines for America (A4A), and the Small UAV Coalition, supported the FAA’s proposed incremental approach to issue a final rule immediately integrating low-risk UAS operations into the NAS while continuing to work on integrating UAS posing a higher risk in separate regulatory actions. Qualcomm Incorporated, Google, Inc., the Oregon Department of Aviation, and the North Dakota Department of Agriculture urged the FAA to move quickly to issue a final rule integrating small UAS operations into the NAS. Google emphasized that ‘‘[a]s the [small UAS] industry evolves, any lengthy delay in the issuance of a final [small UAS] rule would substantially reduce the benefits of the final rule. It will be difficult, if not impossible, for the FAA to adequately consider the many likely technological developments during a protracted rulemaking.’’ The National Association of Flight Instructors added that because UAS are a relatively new technology whose risks are still being studied, the FAA should use ‘‘a phased in set of regulations that ease into basic use of [small UAS] in the NAS with close attention to the degree of responsible use and compliance with regulations before considering relaxation of rules to allow increasing capability of the aircraft.’’ The Coalition of Airline Pilots Associations (CAPA) commented that ‘‘creating a set of regulations and standards that have a lower level of safety in the name of expedience is problematic.’’ CAPA asserted that this rulemaking ‘‘is an opportunity to develop a regulatory schema, using the hard lessons learned over the past one hundred years that has the long-range vision to be capable and integrated to handle the full spectrum of anticipated operations.’’ CAPA also claimed that there may ultimately be remotely piloted vehicles that are the size of commercial transport category aircraft, and that any system put in place to govern UAS must account for this eventuality and provide the appropriate level of regulation. The Flight School Association of North America recommended a 12 to 18-month extension to the rulemaking timeline, ‘‘so that more review can be accomplished.’’ "

    "text":"Discussion of the Applicable Statutory Framework The Mercatus Center at George Mason University and the Competitive Enterprise Institute questioned the Department’s reliance on Public Law 112–95, section 333 as the authority for the proposed rule. Both commenters stated that Public Law 112–95, § 332 includes Congress’ mandate to the FAA to promulgate rules for small UAS integration into the NAS. The Competitive Enterprise Institute urged the Department to clearly articulate why it is invoking section 333 authority, as opposed to § 332(b) authority, as the basis for this rulemaking. Section 332(b)(1) requires the Secretary to publish a final rule allowing for the civil operation of small UAS in the NAS ‘‘to the extent the systems do not meet the requirements for expedited authorization under section 333.’’ Conversely, section 333(a) requires the Secretary to determine whether certain UAS may operate safely in the NAS ‘‘before completion of the plan and rulemaking required by section 332. . . .’’ As part of the consideration under section 333, section 333(b)(2) directs the Secretary to determine whether ‘‘. . . airworthiness certification under section 44704 of title 49, United States Code is required for the operation of unmanned aircraft systems.’’ If the Secretary determines that certain UAS may operate safely in the NAS, then section 333(c) requires the Secretary to ‘‘establish requirements for the safe operation’’ of those UAS in the NAS. Because the statutory text of section 332(b)(1) applies only to those UAS that do not meet the requirements of section 333, sections 332 and 333 cannot both apply to the same UAS. The Department is pursuing this rulemaking under section 333 because section 333(b)(2) allows it to find that airworthiness certification is not necessary for small UAS that will be subject to this rule. As discussed in section III.J.3 of this preamble, the Department has indeed found that mandatory airworthiness certification is unnecessary to ensure the safety or security of these types of small UAS operations. However, unlike section 333(b)(2), section 332 does not contain a provision that would allow the Department to find that airworthiness certification should not be required for a small UAS. Because airworthiness certification is normally a statutory requirement imposed by 49 U.S.C. 44704 and 44711(a)(1), the FAA would have to include an airworthiness certification requirement in this rule if it were to conduct this rulemaking under section 332 rather than section 333. This would impose an additional requirement on small UAS whose operational parameters do not pose a hazard to users of the NAS or a threat to national security. Matternet, Inc. argued that Public Law 112–95 compels the FAA to develop a regulatory framework for unmanned aircraft systems, but does not bind or limit the Agency to existing statutes concerning aviation, or to decades-long aviation regulatory doctrines that, Matternet asserted, do not apply to these new technologies. Furthermore, Matternet argued that because Public Law 112–95, section 333 expressly contemplates that ‘‘certain unmanned aircraft systems [would] operate safely in the NAS before completion of the plan and rulemaking required by section 332,’’ Congress gave the FAA a ‘‘blank slate’’ to create small UAS regulations ‘‘without any suggestion that existing statutes or regulations would act as impediments to the rulemaking process.’’ Matternet also stated that it ‘‘is concerned that the FAA’s proposal is impeded by an apparent notion that statutes, regulations or doctrines that were created decades ago to address manned aircraft operations are mandated to apply to unmanned aircraft, without any safety or economic rationale.’’ Matternet’s argument that existing statutes and regulatory doctrines are limited to manned aircraft operations is foreclosed by precedent."

    "text":"Administrator v. Pirker,33 the NTSB considered the issue of whether an unmanned aircraft is an ‘‘aircraft’’ within the meaning of FAA statutes and regulations and whether it is subject to the existing FAA regulations of part 91, which ‘‘prescribes rules governing the operation of aircraft.’’ 34 The NTSB found that the statutory and regulatory definitions of aircraft are ‘‘clear on their face’’ and ‘‘draw no distinction between whether a device is manned or unmanned.’’ 35 Thus, the NTSB concluded that the existing regulatory provision of § 91.13 (which prohibits careless or reckless operation of an aircraft) apply to the unmanned aircraft operation that was at issue in Pirker.36 The FAA is also unpersuaded by Matternet’s other argument that Public Law 112–95 overturned all existing aviation statutes and regulations, leaving the FAA with a ‘‘blank slate’’ for this rulemaking. The Supreme Court has held that ‘‘[w]hile a later enacted statute . . . can sometimes operate to amend or even repeal an earlier statutory provision . . . repeals by implication are not favored and will not be presumed unless the intention of the legislature to repeal [is] clear and manifest.’’ 37 The Court added that ‘‘[w]e will not infer a statutory repeal ‘‘unless the later statute expressly contradict[s] the original act or unless such a construction is absolutely necessary in order that the words of the later statute shall have any meaning at all.’’ 38 Implied repeals of a longstanding statutory provision are particularly disfavored.39 The aviation statutes at issue here were enacted in 1958 as part of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 (which created the Federal Aviation Agency).40 Because these statutory provisions have been in place for 58 years, they are longstanding statutory provisions whose implied repeal would be particularly disfavored. Many of the pertinent regulatory provisions at issue in this rulemaking are similarly longstanding. For example, the ‘‘see and avoid’’ requirement of § 91.113(b) was created in 1968.41 Thus, for the reasons discussed below, the FAA finds that, with the exception of 49 U.S.C. 44704 and 44711(a)(1), Public Law 112–95 did not repeal these existing statutes and regulations. Section 333 of Public Law 112–95 directs the Secretary of Transportation to determine whether certain UAS may operate safely in the NAS and if so, to establish requirements for the safe operation of such UAS in the NAS.42 With the exception of section 333(b)(2), which allows the Secretary to determine whether the airworthiness-certification requirements of 49 U.S.C. 44704 and 44711(a)(1) should be imposed on certain UAS, section 333 does not expressly contradict any existing statute or regulation. Furthermore, interpreting section 333 as repealing all prior aviation statutes and regulations is unnecessary in order to give meaning to section 333, which simply directs the Secretary to determine whether existing aircraft regulations prohibit or otherwise burden certain UAS operations that could operate safely in the NAS. If the Secretary determines that this is the case, then section 333(c) directs the Secretary to make the appropriate changes to the pertinent regulations. Because, with the exception of section 333(b)(2), section 333 can be given meaning without repealing other existing aviation statutes or regulations, we decline Matternet’s suggestion that section 333 impliedly repeals those statutes or regulations. We also note that section 333(b)(2) provides further evidence that Congress intended section 333 to work in conjunction with the existing aviation statutes. This subsection provides the Secretary with discretion to determine whether airworthiness certification is necessary for UAS subject to this rule. "

    "text":"2. International Operations and ForeignOwned Aircraft The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) has recognized that UAS are aircraft, and as such, existing standards and recommended practices (SARPs) that apply to aircraft apply to UAS. ICAO currently is reviewing the existing SARPs to determine what modifications, if any, need to be made to accommodate UAS. In the U.S., however, UAS may operate with DOT authorization, under the authority of section 333 49 of Public Law 112–95, in a much less restrictive manner than current ICAO SARPs require. Thus, the FAA proposed to limit the applicability of part 107 to small UAS operations that are conducted entirely within the United States. Persons who wish to conduct operations outside of the United States would be able to do so, provided they seek and obtain the proper authorization from the requisite foreign civil aviation authority. In addition, based on the ICAO framework and the current review that ICAO is conducting, the FAA proposed to limit the rule to operations of U.S.- registered UAS. Under 49 U.S.C. 44103 and 14 CFR 47.3, an aircraft can be registered in the United States only if it is not registered under the laws of a foreign country and meets one of the following ownership criteria: • The aircraft is owned by a citizen of the United States; • The aircraft is owned by a permanent resident of the United States; • The aircraft is owned by a corporation that is not a citizen of the United States, but that is organized and doing business under U.S. Federal or State law and the aircraft is based and primarily used in the United States; or • The aircraft is owned by the United States government or a State or local governmental entity. In proposing this requirement, the FAA noted that existing U.S. international trade obligations, including the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), cover certain kinds of operations known as specialty air services. Specialty air services are generally defined as any specialized commercial operation using an aircraft whose primary purpose is not the transportation of goods or passengers, including but not limited to aerial mapping, aerial surveying, aerial photography, forest fire management, firefighting, aerial advertising, glider towing, parachute jumping, aerial construction, helilogging, aerial sightseeing, flight training, aerial inspection and surveillance, and aerial spraying services. The FAA invited comments on whether foreign-registered small unmanned aircraft should be permitted to operate under part 107, or recognized as specialty air services under international trade obligations. With respect to limiting UAS operations under part 107 to operations within the United States, the National Agricultural Aviation Association (NAAA), DJI, and another commenter supported the limitation, but sought clarification and additional guidance material on what steps individuals may need to complete to obtain the proper authorization from foreign civil aviation authorities and the FAA to operate outside the United States. Article 8 of the Chicago Convention specifies that no unmanned aircraft ‘‘shall be flown without a pilot over the territory of a contracting State without special authorization by that State and in accordance with the terms of such authorization.’’ Article 8 also calls on States to undertake ‘‘to insure that the flight of such aircraft without a pilot in regions open to civil aircraft shall be so controlled as to obviate danger to civil aircraft.’’ In accordance with this obligation, the provisions of part 107 set forth the necessary authorizations for operations conducted by U.S. citizens only within the United States. For those seeking to operate outside the United States, special authorization from the foreign civil aviation authority will be required. "

The Nez Perce Tribe—which also supported the proposal to give public aircraft operations the option to declare an operation to be a civil operation and comply with the provisions to proposed part 107— asserted that the proper statutory interpretation of ‘‘public aircraft’’ includes federally recognized Indian tribes. Conversely, NAAA stated that public aircraft operations should continue to be conducted under the COA process. One individual said proposed § 107.11 should be amended to indicate that public agencies may choose to voluntarily operate under part 107. The City of Arlington, Texas requested the ability to follow the small UAS rules, not the COA process. Aerial Services, Inc. also said that public entities should be allowed to operate like commercial operators, but only for research and instructional purposes. Under this rule, a public aircraft operation can continue to operate under a COA or can voluntarily operate as a civil aircraft in compliance with part 107.

UAS America Fund suggested that the final rule make a special allowance for small UAS operations that do not meet all of the criteria of section 336(a) but are conducted for educational or other salutary purposes.Conversely, NAAA, the Transportation Trades Department AFL–CIO (TTD), A4A, the American Chemistry Council, the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, the Southwest Airlines Pilots’ Association (SWAPA) and a number of individual commenters advocated for greater regulation and oversight of all model aircraft operations.

    "text":"Moored balloons, kites, amateur rockets, and unmanned free balloons are currently regulated by the provisions of 14 CFR part 101. Because they are already incorporated into the NAS through part 101, the NPRM proposed to exclude them from the provisions of part 107. The FAA did not receive any comments objecting to this aspect of the NPRM and, as such, this rule will, as proposed, exclude part 101 operations from the applicability of part 107. The FAA did, however, receive several comments asking for clarification as to which types of operation are subject to part 101. The NextGen Air Transportation Program at NC State University and three individuals asked whether tethered powered unmanned aircraft meet the definition of unmanned free balloons and kites, which are subject to part 101. FAA regulations define a balloon as ‘‘a lighter-than-air aircraft that is not engine driven, and that sustains flight through the use of either gas buoyancy or an airborne heater.’’ 60 A kite is defined as ‘‘a framework, covered with paper, cloth, metal, or other material, intended to be flown at the end of a rope or cable, and having as its only support the force of the wind moving past its surfaces.’’ 61 Based on these definitions, a small unmanned aircraft that uses powered systems for actions such as propulsion or steering is not a balloon or kite subject to part 101.62 A commenter asked whether unmanned moored airships and blimps are subject to part 101. In response, the FAA notes that an airship is defined as ‘‘an engine-driven lighter-than-air aircraft that can be steered.’’ 63 Conversely, as discussed previously, the definition of ‘‘balloon’’ excludes aircraft that are engine-driven. Because an airship is not a balloon or kite, a moored unmanned airship is not encompassed by part 101. With regard to blimps, an engine-driven blimp would be considered an airship, which is not subject to part 101. 6. Current Treatment of UAS and Grandfathering of Section 333 Exemption Holders The FAA currently accommodates non-recreational small UAS use through various mechanisms, such as special airworthiness certificates, exemptions, and COAs. However, the FAA recognizes that many holders of exemptions issued under section 333 of Public Law 112–95 (section 333 exemptions) may wish to take advantage of part 107 when it goes into effect. On the other hand, some section 333 exemption holders may prefer to continue operating under the terms and conditions of their exemptions. Therefore, the FAA will allow any section 333 exemption holder to either continue operating under the terms and conditions of the exemption until its expiration, or conduct operations under part 107 as long as the operation falls under part 107. Approximately 40 commenters criticized the framework currently regulating small UAS operations as slow, cumbersome, and inefficient. These commenters expressed concern that the current framework is having an adverse effect on UAS development in the United States. The FAA anticipates that this rulemaking will alleviate many of the concerns commenters raised with the existing UAS framework. Under this rule, many operations that would previously require exemptions and COAs will now fall under the purview of part 107, which generally does not require an exemption or a COA prior to operation. Some commenters, including the American Petroleum Institute and the Consumer Electronics Association (CEA), encouraged the FAA to acknowledge that existing permitted commercial uses of small UAS are unaffected by the rule. The American Petroleum Institute stated that such acknowledgement is necessary to avoid unintended consequences and preserve the expectation and business interests of current authorization holders."

    "text":"The NPRM proposed to define ‘‘small unmanned aircraft’’ as ‘‘an unmanned aircraft weighing less than 55 pounds including everything that is on board the aircraft.’’ The NPRM noted that Public Law 112–95, section 331(6) defines a small unmanned aircraft as ‘‘an unmanned aircraft weighing less than 55 pounds.’’ However, the NPRM pointed out that this statutory definition does not specify whether the 55-pound weight limit refers to the total weight of the aircraft at the time of takeoff (which would encompass the weight of the aircraft and any payload on board) or simply the weight of an empty aircraft. The NPRM proposed to define small unmanned aircraft using total takeoff weight because: (1) Heavier aircraft generally pose greater amounts of public risk in the event of an accident, because they can do more damage to people and property on the ground; and (2) this approach would be similar to the approach that the FAA has taken with other aircraft, such as large aircraft, light-sport aircraft, and small aircraft. Commenters including AOPA, ALPA, and the Helicopter Association International, supported the proposed definition. The New England Chapter of the Association of Unmanned Vehicles International and Devens IOP, commenting jointly, pointed out that there are commercial applications being developed that will need to exceed 55 pounds. Event 38 Unmanned Systems stated that rather than segregate small unmanned aircraft by total weight, the FAA should use a ‘‘kinetic energy split’’ that combines weight and speed. Several commenters asked that the 55- pound weight limit be lowered. Event 38 Unmanned Systems recommended an initial weight restriction of 10 pounds, with adjustments based on subsequent research. Prioria Robotics, Inc. stated that the weight limitation for small unmanned aircraft should be less than 25 pounds, and that the definition should include a requirement that the aircraft be ‘‘hand-launchable.’’ Another commenter asked for the weight limit to be reduced to 33 pounds. Green Vegans stated that FAA must provide test data on the collision impact of a 55-pound UAS, traveling at various speeds, on both humans and birds. The advocacy group argued that the public cannot make informed comments on the proposed weight limitation without such data. The advocacy group also noted that such data would be provided by a National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) Environmental Impact Statement, which the group stated the FAA must do. Crew Systems similarly opposed the maximum weight limitation, arguing that FAA provided no justification for it. The company asserted that a 55-pound UAS is large enough to be hazardous when operated in an urban environment, even if care is taken. Although it did not expressly object to the weight limitation, the United States Ultralight Association also expressed concern about the significant damage that a 50-plus-pound unmanned aircraft could do to light, open-cockpit aircraft. Other commenters asked the FAA to increase the 55-pound weight limit. Consumers Energy Company objected to the definition’s proposed weight limitation as too light, arguing that a 55- pound weight restriction will negatively impact small UAS flight times and the usage of alternative fuel sources. Consumers Energy urged the FAA to consider fuel loads and to increase the weight restriction to 120 pounds. The commenter also suggested that, if the FAA has concerns about safety, it could create subcategories under which maximum weight restriction is imposed on the fuel load, rather than adopt a blanket weight restriction.

The FAA did not include the ‘‘pilot in command’’ reference in the proposed definition of small UAS because that position did not exist under the NPRM. Even though the FAA is creating a remote pilot in command position in this final rule, the FAA considers adding a reference to that position in the small UAS definition as unnecessary. AirShip Technologies Group, Inc. (AirShip Technologies) supported the proposed definition. Conversely, Transport Canada asked the FAA to consider whether it would be better to use the ICAO terminology of remotely piloted aircraft system (RPAS) instead of small UAS. Foxtrot Consulting, LLC stated that the inclusion of the phrase ‘‘associated elements (including communications links and the components that control the small unmanned aircraft)’’ in the definition of small UAS creates a ‘‘regulatory nightmare,’’ because it means cellular network providers and their infrastructure are considered part of a small UAS. The commenter pointed out that small UAS can be controlled via Wi-Fi and cellular networks, which opens enormous capabilities to small UAS operations. The commenter went on, however, to question whether, as a result of the proposed definition, a cellular provider is liable if a UAS being controlled through their network causes damage to property, serious injury, or death. The proposed definition of small UAS is derived from the statutory definition of ‘‘unmanned aircraft system’’ in Public Law 112–95, § 331(9). As such, this final rule will codify the proposed definition. Because Congress has selected the term ‘‘unmanned aircraft system’’ to describe this type of a system, the FAA may not use a different term, such as RPAS, in this rule. With regard to cellular providers, the requirements of this rule apply only to the remote pilot, the owner of the small UAS, and people who may be involved in the operation of the small UAS. As such, a cellular provider whose involvement in the small UAS operation is limited to a remote pilot simply using the provider’s infrastructure would not be in violation of part 107 if something were to go wrong. The FAA does not opine on liability issues that are beyond the scope of this rule, such as whether the provider may be liable to the remote pilot or third parties under tort or contract law. The NextGen Air Transportation Program at NC State University and another commenter recommended specifically stating that tethered powered small UAS are considered small UAS under proposed part 107. In response to these comments, the FAA notes that the definition of small UAS in this rule includes tethered powered small UAS."

Several commenters noted that using the term ‘‘operator’’ in part 107 could result in confusion. NTSB, ALPA, and TTD pointed out that ‘‘operator’’ is currently used to refer to a business entity and that use of that term to refer to a small UAS pilot would be inconsistent with existing usage. Transport Canada and several other commenters stated that ICAO defines the person manipulating the flight controls of a small UAS as a ‘‘remote pilot’’ and asked the FAA to use this terminology in order to harmonize with ICAO. Transport Canada also noted that: (1) Canada uses the same terminology as ICAO; and (2) calling an airman certificate issued under part 107 an ‘‘operator certificate’’ may lead to confusion with FAA regulations in part 119, which allow a business entity to obtain an operating certificate to transport people and property. ALPA and TTD suggested that the person manipulating the controls of the small UAS should be referred to as a pilot, asserting that this would be consistent with how the word pilot has traditionally been used. As pointed out by the commenters, FAA regulations currently use the term ‘‘commercial operator’’ to refer to a person, other than an air carrier, who engages in the transportation of persons or property for compensation or hire.66 Commercial operators are issued an ‘‘operating certificate’’ under 14 CFR part 119.67 Because other FAA regulations already use the term ‘‘operator’’ to refer to someone other than a small UAS pilot under part 107, the FAA agrees with commenters that use of the term ‘‘operator’’ in this rule could be confusing. In considering alternative terminology to replace the term ‘‘operator,’’ the FAA noted that ICAO 68 and the United Kingdom 69 both use the term ‘‘remote pilot’’ to refer to the person manipulating the flight controls of a small UAS. Additionally, as pointed out by Transport Canada, Canada also uses the term ‘‘remote pilot.’’ Accordingly, this rule will use the term ‘‘remote pilot’’ instead of ‘‘operator’’ in order to harmonize with international terminology. Consequently, the FAA has changed the name of the airmancertificate issued under part 107 to a ‘‘remote pilot certificate with a small UAS rating.’’ In addition, as discussed below, this rule will create a new crewmember position of ‘‘remote pilot in command.’’ The remote pilot in command will be a certificated airman and will have the final authority and responsibility for the operation and safety of a small UAS operation. Because the FAA anticipates that the remote pilot in command will often also be the person manipulating the flight controls of a small UAS, there is no need to have a separately defined crewmember position for the person manipulating the flight controls. Accordingly, the proposed definition of ‘‘operator’’ has been removed from this rule."

Commenters including Aerius Flight, NetMoby, Predesa, and NRECA, generally agreed that a separate operator in command designation is not necessary for small UAS operations. NBAA commented that since small UAS operations will largely be excluded from airspace covered by traditional definitions of ‘‘operator’’ and ‘‘pilot,’’ there is no need to create a separate operator in command position for part 107 operations. Other commenters requested that the FAA include a separate ‘‘operator in command’’ position in the final rule similar to the PIC position used in manned-aircraft operations. The University of North Dakota’s John D. Odegard School of Aerospace Sciences pointed out that due to a wide variety of system configurations available for small UAS, it is possible that one or more flight crew members or sensor stations may affect the flight path of the unmanned aircraft. Accordingly, the commenter recommended that the term operator-in-command be added and defined in the rule to reflect the final authority and responsibility for the operation and safety of the flight.ArgenTech Solutions, Inc. also recommended the rule address the title of operator-in-command and specify the requirements for operator hand-off of small UAS. Similarly, the Kansas State University UAS Program recommended clarification of responsibility in regard to operations with multiple operators and noted that creation of an operator\u0002in-command designation would be an appropriate clarification. As discussed below, this rule will allow small UAS to be operated by more than one person for purposes such as instruction or crew augmentation. As such, the FAA agrees that there needs to be a designated crewmember who is responsible for the safe operation of a small UAS and has final authority over that operation. Thus, this rule will create a new crewmember position of remote pilot in command. Just as with manned-aircraft PICs, the remote pilot in command: (1) Must be designated as remote pilot in command before or during the flight; and (2) will have the final authority and responsibility for the operation. In light of this change, the FAA has amended the regulatory text of part 107 to transfer the duties that the NPRM proposed to impose on the operator to the remote pilot in command and, where appropriate, to the person manipulating the flight controls of the small UAS. The remote pilot in command will also be generally responsible for ensuring that the small UAS operation complies with all applicable FAA regulations. Turning to the comments about operator hand-off, a person manipulating the flight controls of a small UAS may be augmented by another person during operation. Specifically, the person manipulating the flight controls may safely transfer the controls to another person during flight as long as the transfer does not violate the operational provisions of part 107 and a remote pilot in command is designated."

The NPRM also proposed to create a new airman certificate to be issued for small UAS operations in place of the existing part 61 pilot certificates that focus on manned-aircraft operations. Many commenters, including Air Tractor, Inc., Ag Info Tech, LLC, and the American Fuel & Petrochemicals Manufacturers, supported the proposal to require the person manipulating the flight controls of a small UAS to obtain a part 107 airman certificate. Commenters generally supported this provision because it was viewed as an economical means to achieve the rule’s safety objective. Commenters including Modovolate and the National Association of Broadcasters stated the proposed approach of adding a new category of airmen provides a good balance with the need to verify operator qualifications without unduly burdening the operators. Several commenters disagreed with the proposed airman certification requirement. Airship Technologies argued that an airman certificate is unnecessary to operate a small UAS and asserted that the proposed regulatory framework is too complex, costly, and burdensome for both the public and the FAA. Airship Technologies suggested that the operator should instead depend upon the product manufacturer’s training in the form of classes and documented materials. Another commenter asserted that processing certificate applications will create a backlog for the FAA. Yet another commenter suggested a self-certification procedure in lieu of a required airman certificate asserting that the proposed certificate would offer little benefit to the operators or the NAS. Commenters from the educational and academic community, including Princeton University and the Council on Government Relations, suggested that a remote-pilot-in-command position should allow a faculty member acting as a remote pilot in command to oversee student operators utilizing small UAS as part of a course or research activity. Princeton University expressed concern over requiring the person manipulating the flight controls of a small UAS to hold an airman certificate, citing complications in the academic environment. Princeton provided scenarios where students would use a small UAS in projects as part of their academic courses and the challenges involved in obtaining an operator certificate prior to testing their project. To resolve these concerns, Princeton recommended that universities be able to obtain an ‘‘Educational UAS License,’’ which would give them the authority to designate an ‘‘Operator-in\u0002Command’’ and administer the knowledge test to appropriate faculty and staff. The FAA agrees with the majority of comments that an airman certificate to operate a small UAS should be required unless directly supervised by a remote pilot in command. This is in fact a statutory requirement, as 49 U.S.C.44711(a)(2)(A) prohibits a person from serving in any capacity as an airman with respect to a civil aircraft used or intended to be used in air commerce ‘‘without an airman certificate authorizing the airman to serve in the capacity for which the certificate was issued.’’ "

Thus, the NPRM posited that in an emergency situation, an operator should be able to promptly land the small unmanned aircraft without needing to deviate from any part 107 regulations. The NPRM invited comments as to whether a small UAS remote pilot in command should be permitted to exercise emergency powers similar to those available to a PIC under § 91.3. Several commenters including AUVSI, AIA, and Trimble Navigation, supported allowing small UAS operators to exercise emergency powers in certain circumstances. Prioria provided examples where a small UAS may need to violate the proposed 500- foot altitude limit and the visual-line-of\u0002sight requirement in order to avoid a collision with a manned aircraft or remove an uncontrollable small unmanned aircraft from the NAS. Another commenter provided an example of a situation where the only viable option to prevent a mid-air collision would violate the prohibition on operations over people (as a result of any lateral movement by the UAS) or the various operational restrictions in § 107.51 (as a result of any vertical movement by the UAS). The Permanent Editorial Board of the Aviators Model Code of Conduct Initiative noted that there are scenarios where unauthorized small UAS penetration of controlled airspace may be required to avoid an accident, and proposed that the FAA authorize small UAS operators to penetrate controlled airspace to the extent necessary to avoid (at least) personal injury or death. One commenter said small UAS operators should be permitted to exercise emergency powers, but only to prevent serious injury, death, or a mid\u0002air collision. Southern Company and Trimble recommended permitting UAS operators to deviate from FAA regulations in emergencies to mitigate injury, damage, or risk. Southern Company argued that by not extending emergency deviation authority to UAS operators, the FAA could be forcing a UAS operator to choose between deviating from FAA regulations and ensuring safety. Several commenters, including Skycatch, Clayco, and AUVSI, specifically recommended revising proposed § 107.19 to be consistent with 14 CFR 91.3—i.e., allow an operator to deviate from any rule of part 107 to the extent required in an emergency requiring immediate action, and require, upon the request of the Administrator, the operator to submit a written report of that deviation.

Planehook cited Articles 28 and 8 of the Convention on International Civil Aviation, which the commenter said creates the basis for nations to grant emergency powers to the PIC of an aircraft in distress, and Article 8, which the commenter said states that each contracting State undertakes to ensure that the flight of such aircraft without a pilot in regions open to civil aircraft shall be controlled so as to obviate danger to civil aircraft.

    "text":"Currently, 14 CFR 91.113(b) imposes a generally applicable requirement that, during flight, ‘‘vigilance shall be maintained by each person operating an aircraft so as to see and avoid other aircraft.’’ This see-and-avoid requirement is at the heart of the FAA’s regulatory structure, mitigating the risk of aircraft colliding in midair. This requirement is currently satisfied in manned-aircraft operations by a pilot on board the manned aircraft looking out from inside the aircraft to see whether other aircraft are on a collision course with the pilot’s aircraft. However, the person controlling the small UAS cannot see other aircraft in the same manner because he or she is not inside the aircraft. That is why Public Law 112–95, section 333(b)(1) requires the FAA to consider, as a critical factor in this rulemaking, whether a small UAS operation is conducted ‘‘within visual line of sight.’’ To address this issue, the NPRM proposed that the operator of the small UAS must always be capable of maintaining visual line of sight of the small unmanned aircraft unaided by any technology other than glasses or contact lenses. The NPRM also proposed creating a new position of visual observer to assist the operator in maintaining visual line of sight. Under that proposal, if a visual observer is used in the operation, then the visual observer could watch the small unmanned aircraft instead of the operator. However, if a visual observer was not used in the operation, then the operator would have to exercise his or her visual-line-of-sight capability to watch the small unmanned aircraft. As proposed in the NPRM, the operator or visual observer would have to be able to see the small unmanned aircraft throughout the entire flight in order to: (1) Know the unmanned aircraft’s location; (2) determine the unmanned aircraft’s attitude, altitude, and direction; (3) observe the airspace for other air traffic or hazards; and (4) determine that the unmanned aircraft does not endanger the life or property of another. The NPRM also proposed that even if a visual observer is used, at all times during flight, the small unmanned aircraft must remain close enough to the operator for the operator to be capable of seeing the aircraft with vision unaided by any device other than corrective lenses. For the reasons discussed below, this rule will make three changes to the NPRM visual-line-of-sight framework but will otherwise finalize it as proposed. First, because of the change in the small UAS crewmember framework (discussed in the previous section of this preamble), this rule will replace the operator with the person manipulating the flight controls of the small UAS and the remote pilot in command, who in many instances will be the same person. Second, this rule will make clarifying amendments to the regulatory text. Third, this rule will make the visual-line-of-sight requirement waivable. A number of commenters expressed concern about whether the visual-line\u0002of-sight framework proposed in the NPRM would sufficiently mitigate risk. Foxtrot Consulting, the Air Medical Operators Association, the Professional Helicopter Pilots Association, and several individuals asserted that the unaided human eye is not adequate to see and avoid other aircraft. Additionally, these commenters argued that the small unmanned aircraft will be too small to be seen by a manned\u0002aircraft pilot, and, with no lighting requirement, the unmanned aircraft may be all but invisible, particularly in minimum visual-flight-rules (VFR) conditions. Similarly, commenters, including A4A and several individuals, questioned whether small UAS remote pilots would be capable of perceiving potential conflicts and responsibly complying with the principle of ‘‘see and avoid.’’"

First, this rule will define a visual observer as a person who assists the remote pilot in command and the person manipulating the flight controls of the small UAS (if that personis not the remote pilot in command) to see and avoid other air traffic or objects aloft or on the ground. Second, the visual observer will remain an optional crewmember who will not be required to obtain an airman certificate. Third, the remote pilot in command will have to ensure that the visual observer is positioned in a location that allows him or her to see the unmanned aircraft in the manner specified in § 107.31. Fourth, the visual observer, the remote pilot in command, and the person manipulating the flight controls of the small UAS (if that person is not the remote pilot in command) will be required to coordinate in order to: (1) Scan the airspace where the small unmanned aircraft is operating for any potential collision hazard; and (2) maintain awareness of the position of the small unmanned aircraft through direct visual observation. Finally, this rule will require the visual observer, the remote pilot in command, and the person manipulating the flight controls of the small UAS (if that person is not the remote pilot in command) to maintain effective communication, and it will allow the use of technology, such as radios, to assist with the communication. The NPRM proposed to define a visual observer as a person who assists the operator to see and avoid other air traffic or objects aloft or on the ground. Skycatch suggested that the definition of visual observer should be revised to say ‘‘sense and avoid’’ rather than ‘‘see and avoid’’ because the term ‘‘sense and avoid’’ is the term required by Congress. According to Skycatch, the term ‘‘see and avoid’’ does not appear in Public Law 112–95, whereas the term ‘‘sense and avoid’’ appears in three locations in the enabling legislation. As discussed earlier, this rulemaking is being conducted under section 333 of Public Law 112–95. Subsection 333(b)(1) requires the FAA to determine, in pertinent part, what type of UAS operations do not ‘‘create a hazard to users of the national airspace system.’’ A critical component of that determination is whether the operation is conducted ‘‘within visual line of sight.’’ Id. Section 333 does not use the term ‘‘sense and avoid.’’ As discussed in the previous section, the FAA does not currently have data indicating that small UAS technology has matured to the point that would safely allow small UAS to be operated beyond visual line of sight. To reflect this fact, as well as the fact that section 333 explicitly focuses on operations within visual line of sight as a critical consideration, this rule will retain the proposed ‘‘see and avoid’’ terminology in the definition of visual observer. Accordingly, this rule will define visual observer as a person who assists the remote pilot in command and the person manipulating the flight controls of the small UAS (if that person is not the remote pilot in command) to see and avoid other air traffic or objects aloft or on the ground. ii. Operational Requirements When Using Visual Observer The NPRM also proposed a set of operational requirements for operations that use a visual observer. First, the operator and visual observer would be required to maintain effective communication with each other at all times."

    "text":"Under the proposed rule, a visual observer would be an optional crewmember who could be used to augment the small UAS operation. For the reasons discussed below, this rule will finalize this NPRM provision as proposed. Several commenters argued that a visual observer should always be required in order to satisfy the visual\u0002line-of-sight requirements of part 107. ALPA and TTD asserted that small unmanned aircraft are difficult to observe given their size and speed capabilities, and that this difficulty, combined with the remote pilot’s need to look down at the controls periodically, makes a visual observer a critical crewmember for the safe operation of a small unmanned aircraft. Similarly, NAAA stated that the FAA’s proposal not to require a visual observer is at odds with the fundamental see\u0002and-avoid and visual-line-of-sight principles of the rule. NAAA argued that the NAS would be endangered by the absence of a visual observer in those situations in which the remote pilot temporarily lacks the ability to see and avoid other aircraft. Several commenters stated that in the absence of a visual observer, a remote pilot would not be able to maintain situational awareness of activities in the air and on the ground. JAM Aviation stated that a remote pilot cannot easily monitor conditions in the air and on the ground simultaneously, and that a visual observer is needed to assist the remote pilot in doing so. Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi Lone StarUAS Center of Excellence & Innovation (Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi/ LSUASC) stated that a visual observer should be required until technology comes into existence, such as first\u0002person view, that would provide ‘‘situational awareness and [a] level of risk-mitigation comparable to that of a pilot in the cockpit of a commercial aircraft.’’ Similarly, another commenter argued that a visual observer should be required ‘‘unless some form of situational awareness aid is available which would allow the operator to simultaneously determine [small UAS] status and health as well as scan the surrounding airspace[.]’’ It is not necessary to require a visual observer for all small UAS operations. Under the visual-line-of-sight framework of this rule, a visual observer can act as a limited substitute for the remote pilot in command and the person manipulating the flight controls with regard to maintaining visual line of sight of the small unmanned aircraft. The visual observer position will allow the person manipulating the small UAS flight controls and the remote pilot in command to perform tasks that require looking away from the small unmanned aircraft for a significant period of time or use observational technology (such as FPV) that limits their peripheral vision; which they can do if a visual observer is present because the visual observer will observe the small unmanned aircraft with the naked eye. However, there are some small UAS operations in which the person manipulating the UAS flight controls (if that person is not the remote pilot in command) and the remote pilot in command will simply observe the small unmanned aircraft themselves throughout the entire operationIn those types of operations, there is no need for a visual observer to be present to maintain visual line of sight of the unmanned aircraft. In response to concerns about the ability of the remote pilot to maintain see and avoid if there is no visual observer present, the FAA notes that, as discussed previously, the person maintaining visual line of sight will have the same (if not better) ability to see and avoid other aircraft as a manned-aircraft pilot looking out the windshield of the manned aircraft"

    "text":"The NPRM proposed to not require airman certification or other mandatory testing or training for a visual observer. The FAA explained that because a visual observer would not be permitted to exercise independent judgment or operational control and because the visual observer’s role in the operation would be limited simply to communicating what he or she is seeing to another person, the visual observer would not be an airman as defined by statute and would therefore not be statutorily required to obtain an airman certificate. The NPRM also explained that because of the limited role of the visual observer, there would be no need to exercise the FAA’s regulatory authority to require the visual observer to obtain an airman certificate.80 For the reasons discussed below, this rule will not require visual observers to be certificated or to satisfy any other qualification requirements. Several commenters expressed support for the FAA’s proposal to not require airman certification for visual observers on the basis that certification is unnecessary. Many submissions, including those from NRECA, the Nez Perce Tribe, and the National Association of Realtors, supported the FAA’s proposal because a visual observer is optional for part 107 operations and is not responsible for operating the device. The Property Drone Consortium, NetMoby, Predesa, the National Association of Wheat Growers, and the American Petroleum Institute generally commented that a visual observer should not have to satisfy airman requirements. The Professional Society of Drone Journalists added that the only requirement for visual observers should be that they are capable of visually observing the small UAS and communicating with the remote pilot. Other commenters suggested that airman certification should not be required for visual observers because the limited safety benefits of requiring certification would not justify the burden. Commenters including the University of Arkansas, Division of Agriculture and State Farm asserted that the costs of requiring visual observer airman certification would outweigh the benefits. The Oklahoma Governor’s Unmanned Aerial Systems Council said that imposing additional regulatory requirements on visual observers could increase safety risks since organizations would then be incentivized to minimize the number of visual observers due to cost and logistical issues. Similarly, NRECA suggested that the imposition of certification requirements could discourage the use of visual observersMultiple commenters expressed the opposite view and asserted that visual observers should be certificated by the FAA. NAAA stated that the visual observer should be certificated and should clearly understand his or her role. CAPA recommended that only UAS remote pilots, licensed as such, be able to participate as visual observers. CAPA also raised the question of who would be held responsible if an accident were to occur due to an uncertificated visual observer’s negligence. Textron Systems suggested that visual observers with safety-of-flight responsibilities may be considered to be flight crewmembers and should be certificated as such. A few individuals generally argued that the same testing requirements should apply to all participants in small UAS operations, including the remote pilot and visual observer. One individual commented that a certificated visual observer could act as a safety redundancy backup for the operator.Another commenter suggested that UAS operator teams should follow a process similar to the traditional airman certification process."

    "text":"Due to the reduced visibility associated with nighttime operations, the NPRM proposed to prohibit the operation of a small UAS outside the hours of official sunrise and sunset. For the reasons discussed below, this rule will maintain the prohibition on nighttime operations but will allow small UAS operations to be conducted during civil twilight if the small unmanned aircraft has lighted anti\u0002collision lighting visible for at least 3 statute miles. The nighttime-operations prohibition in this rule will also be waivable. Approximately 25 commenters generally supported the proposed prohibition on operations outside the hours of official sunrise and sunset. ALPA noted that the prohibition is consistent with the ARC recommendations. The Minneapolis\u0002Saint Paul Metropolitan Airports Commission (Metropolitan Airports Commission) asserted that nighttime operations introduce a number of visual illusions, and unlike manned-aircraft pilots, small UAS operators will not be required to complete comprehensive training programs that teach pilots how to deal with these illusions. The City and County of Denver, Colorado noted that allowing operations only in the lightest of conditions will increase the probability of avoidance in the event of a conflict. Federal Airways provided some conditions and limitations under which they would support nighttime operations of UAS, but ultimately noted that if the goal is to be as least burdensome as possible, limiting operating hours to daylight hours only would eliminate the need for further specification in lighting requirements. The American Association of Airport Executives and Barrick Gold of North America, Inc. concurred with the nighttime operation prohibition, but added that in the future, technological advances may provide the opportunity to allow nighttime operations. Other commenters objected to the proposed prohibition on nighttime operations. Skycatch, Clayco, AECOM and DPR Construction, commenting jointly, and several individuals, suggested that the proposed prohibition on nighttime operations be entirely eliminated from the final rule. Cherokee Nation Technologies and The Information Technology and Innovation Foundation asserted that nighttime operations can be safer than daytime operations because there is less air traffic and there are fewer people on the ground. EEI and AUVSI suggested that nighttime UAS operations are safer and less disruptive than nighttime manned\u0002aircraft operations such as helicopters circling overhead. Virginia Commonwealth University Honors Students said the proposed ban on nighttime operations ignores the use of other senses, particularly sound, to detect and avoid other aircraft. DJI stated that because manned aircraft operating at night are required to be equipped with lighting, UAS operators would be able to satisfy their see-andavoid requirements, even when operating at night. A large number of commenters who opposed the daytime-only restriction of small UAS operations proposed several methods of mitigating hazards. The mitigation strategies were generally related to improving visibility to support see-and-avoid, augmenting see\u0002and-avoid with technology, implementing additional restrictions for operations at night, and requiring additional certification or training. additional certification or training. For example, the Airborne Law Enforcement Association, NBAA, and the National Ski Areas Association said nighttime operations of small UAS could be conducted safely if the aircraft is equipped with proper lighting.

This rule will finalize these minimum-flight-visibility and cloud-clearance requirements as proposed in the NPRM but will make those requirements waivable. Commenters including NAAA, ALPA, and Commonwealth Edison Company supported the proposed minimum flight visibility and distance-from-clouds requirements. Commonwealth Edison asserted that the proposed visibility requirements, in combination with the other proposed operational requirements, would ‘‘safeguard safety while recognizing reasonable commercial interests in such a rapidly evolving technological environment.’’ NAAA stated that the proposed requirements are consistent with the VFR visibility requirements under 14 CFR 91.155 and 91.115. The Professional Helicopter Pilots Association strongly agreed that ‘‘weather minimums be at least basic VFR.’’ ALPA also agreed that all operations must take place in visual meteorological conditions (VMC) with the identified cloud clearances. ALPA further recommended that it be made clear that the 3-mile visibility requirement for VMC does not mean that the visual-line-of-sight required elsewhere in the proposed regulation can necessarily be maintained at 3 miles. Modovolate Aviation, NAMIC, the Property Drone Consortium, and a few individuals generally opposed the imposition of minimum flight visibility and distance-from-cloud requirements. The commenters asserted that such requirements are unnecessary, given the visual-line-of sight requirement of § 107.31. Modovolate stated that it is unlikely that an operator can keep a small UAS in sight at a distance of 3 miles, so a separate weather-visibility requirement is redundant. Modovolate also stated that a small UAS operator cannot maintain visual contact with his small UAS if it is flown in a cloud, but he would be able to fly his small UAS closer than 500 or 1,000 feet to a well\u0002defined cloud without risk. The Professional Society of Drone Journalists (PSDJ), and Edison Electric Institute, individually and jointly with NRECA and APPA, recommended the removal of the cloud distance requirements altogether. PSDJ asserted that the proposed cloud distance requirements would render many types of weather coverage and research projects impossible and would also make it impossible for small UAS to replace high-risk manned flights, ‘‘such as inspecting tower, bridges, or other structures,’’ as contemplated by the NPRM. The Travelers Companies, Inc. recommended the removal of the requirement that small UAS maintain a distance of no less than 2,000 feet horizontally from a cloud, claiming it is not relevant or workable for pilots flying small UAS from the ground. Aerial Services added that the safety concerns associated with cloud clearance will be alleviated with automation, the maximum altitude restriction, and the restriction on the use of small UAS in the vicinity of airports.  Several other commenters generally supported the imposition of minimum flight visibility and cloud clearance requirements, but said the proposed minimum requirements should be reduced.  "

In response, the FAA notes that a person is unlikely to be able to maintain visual line of sight of a small unmanned aircraft that is flying above the clouds. Schertz Aerial Services, the Permanent Editorial Board of the Aviators Model Code of Conduct Initiative, and the City and County of Denver, Colorado suggested that the proposed flight-visibility and minimum\u0002cloud-distance requirements be increased. Schertz Aerial Services said that because UAS are so much smaller than manned aircraft, the proposed 3- mile flight visibility requirement, which was developed for manned aircraft, is not adequate for UAS and should be increased to 5 statute miles. Denver also recommended increasing the minimum flight visibility requirement to 5 statute miles, but only in controlled airspace. The commenter additionally recommended the imposition of a 2,000- foot ceiling for operations in controlled airspace. ‘‘Those visibility enhancements,’’ Denver continued, ‘‘will maximize opportunities for both the operator and other aircraft pilots to successfully employ the see-and-avoid technique.’’ One commenter said the minimum flight visibility requirement should be increased to 10 to 12 miles and the distance-from-cloud requirements should both be increased by 1,000 feet. Another commenter said the FAA should set a specific percentage or range for cloud coverage to be allowed during flight, in addition to the distance-from\u0002cloud requirements. The FAA recognizes the fact that increased flight visibility would provide more time for the remote pilot in command to maneuver away from other aircraft. However, the likelihood of the remote pilot seeing other small UAS, other smaller aircraft, or other hazards such as power lines or antennas from a distance of five or more miles is not probable, so such a requirement would not create an additional safety buffer. A 5-mile visibility requirement above 10,000 feet mean sea level (not including the surface to 2,500 feet above ground level) is imposed by part 91 because manned-aircraft pilots have a need for increased visibility at that higher altitude due to permitted airspeeds above 288 mph. A remote pilot in command, on the other hand, will remain on the ground and will have to deal with ground obstacles that impede vision. The remote pilot in command will also be looking into the sky at a slant angle from the ground rather than horizontally in the manner of a manned-aircraft pilot. This means that a remote pilot will generally be challenged to perceive useful information from his or her vision beyond three miles. An increase in the cloud distance requirements poses the same dilemma, unless the object is large enough or distinct enough it will not likely be visible early enough to provide the opportunity to avoid or change course sooner. PlaneSense and Cobalt Air, commenting jointly, recommended prohibiting a remote pilot from operating a small UAS if the ceiling is lower than 1000 feet MSL. The commenters contended that for manned aircraft, the pilot is in the aircraft and is therefore better able to make a determination about the distance to a cloud from the aircraft than an operator on the ground positioned 1/4 mile away from the unmanned aircraft.The FAA declines to prohibit small UAS operations when cloud ceilings arelower than 1,000 feet AGL.87 Specifically, the FAA disagrees that the remote pilot in command will not be in a position to determine whether the unmanned aircraft is positioned sufficiently far enough from a cloud to meet the requirements of § 107.51(d)."

As discussed in the NPRM, the smaller visual profile of the small unmanned aircraft, the lack of collision-avoidance technology on the aircraft, and the difference in speed between the unmanned and manned aircraft increases the difficulty for manned-aircraft pilots to see and avoid the small unmanned aircraft. As such, this rule will require that the small unmanned aircraft always be the one to initiate an avoidance maneuver to avoid collision with any other user of the NAS. This rule will also include the NPRM-proposed requirement prohibiting the operation of a small unmanned aircraft so close to another aircraft as to create a collision hazard. Approximately 20 commenters agreed with the proposal that small unmanned aircraft must always yield the right of way to all other users of the NAS. Several commenters stated that the requirement is sensible because small unmanned aircraft are more difficult to see than manned aircraft. Numerous other commenters, including NAAA, stated that small unmanned aircraft are more maneuverable than manned aircraft and therefore would have less difficulty taking evasive action to avoid a collision with a manned aircraft. On the other hand, the Small UAV Coalition suggested that in certain circumstances it may be preferable to have a manned-helicopter yield to a small unmanned aircraft. The Small UAV Coalition presented a scenario where a small UAS is being operated to film a newsworthy event. If a manned helicopter were to arrive later to also film the event, under the proposed rule, the small UAS would be required to yield right of way to the helicopter. The commenter suggested that safety would be better served if both the manned and unmanned aircraft maintained awareness so as to see and avoid each other and proposed that part 107 adopt the right-of-way rules currently used in part 91. Another commenter suggested that the FAA should consider creating different right-of-way rules for different classes of NAS users. Requiring small unmanned aircraft to always yield the right of way to all other users of the NAS is a critical component of the see-and-avoid framework of part 107. As discussed in the NPRM, the small size associated with small unmanned aircraft will make those aircraft more difficult to detect for manned-aircraft pilots. Additionally, small UAS operating under this rule will not be required to be equipped with collision avoidance technology, such as transponders or TCAS, that would make it easier for manned-aircraft pilots to detect a small unmanned aircraft operating in their vicinity. Conversely, because of the far larger size and higher noise profile of manned aircraft, the person maintaining visual line of sight as part of a small UAS operation will be in a far better position to detect other users of the NAS and initiate maneuvers to avoid a collision. As such, this rule will retain the proposed requirement that the small unmanned aircraft must always be the one to initiate an avoidance maneuver to avoid collision with any other user of the NAS. This rule will make this requirement waivable for individual small UAS operations (if the proposed operation can safely be conducted under the terms of a certificate of waiver), but will otherwise retain the right-of-way requirement as proposed in the NPRM. When yielding the right of way, the small unmanned aircraft should optimally yield to manned aircraft in such a manner that the manned aircraft is never presented with a see-and-avoid decision or the impression that it must maneuver to avoid the small unmanned aircraft.

Daniel Webster College, NAAA, the California Aviation Agricultural Association, and the Colorado Aviation Agricultural Association (CoAAA) recommended an ADS–B Out equipment requirement to increase small UAS visibility. NAAA and CoAAA said ADS–B Out technology, or the like, should be required pending its effectiveness and usability to track UAS. Several of the commenters who supported an ADS–B requirement addressed the availability of ADS–B systems for small UAS. NAAA and CoAAA stated that ADS–B Out equipment is currently available on the market for use in UAS. NAAA asserted that these units weigh as little as 300 grams and cost as little as $1,200. Airware also asserted that ADS–B Out transponders currently exist that are small and cost effective enough for small UAS. The company noted, however, that this technology is only suitable for uncontrolled airspace because transponders are not currently certificated by the FAA. One commenter said that a technologically and economically feasible option would be to use ‘‘the more inexpensive, heavy, and power-hungry ADS–B transponder[s]’’ by placing them on the ground near the operator. This would work, the commenter said, because most missions include a reliable command and control data link between a UAS and its ground operator. Modovolate recommended ADS–B Out and In requirements for small UAS weighing between 20 and 55 pounds. The company noted that the purpose of ADS–B In (i.e., equipment to receive and present ADS–B information to the small UAS operator) is to alert the operator to manned aircraft in the general vicinity, so that the operator can take precautionary action to avoid the manned aircraft once it is within the operator’s line of sight. An individual similarly recommended that all small UAS over 1.5 kilograms should have a capability for ADS–B In for operators to be able to sense and avoid other aircraft. Several commenters discussed an ADS–B requirement for small UAS in the context of the FAA’s 2020 deadline for equipping manned aircraft with the same technology. The Air Medical Operators Association and Schertz Aerial Services recommended the same deadline be imposed for small UAS. Schertz Aerial Services said that five years ‘‘will provide an adequate amount of time for ADS–B Out to miniaturize and lower in cost, so that ADS–B Out can be more practically incorporated into UAS.’’ The Metropolitan Airports Commission pointed out specifically that the 2020 deadline would apply to manned aircraft operating in Class B airspace, and recommended that FAA ‘‘strongly consider’’ an ADS–B Out requirement for small UAS operating in Class B airspace. The Commission noted that, because ADS–B equipment is developed in larger quantities, the cost to equip small UAS may become reasonable. AMA and the Experimental Aircraft Association (EAA) also noted the 2020 deadline for manned aircraft to be equipped with ADS–B Out equipment, and said any requirement for ADS–B Out in small UAS should not ‘‘justify further equipment requirements for GA aircraft.’’ The commenters stressed ‘‘the importance of maintaining the current timeline and requirements for ADS–B.’’Several commenters recommended ADS–B requirements in certain circumstances.

Conversely, Transport Canada questioned whether the statement in the NPRM that the proposed rule would not establish equipment requirements included radio equipment when operating in areas where ATC coordination/communication is a requirement. The commenter asserted that radio communication is a large contributor to the situational awareness of all pilots, and asked whether the FAA is considering mandating radio equipment, either on the aircraft or at the ground station, for operations in these areas. The Professional Helicopter Pilots Association and NAAA went one step further, recommending that small UAS operations in controlled airspace be required to meet part 91 requirements, which include a requirement for two\u0002way radio communication with ATC. The Professional Helicopter Pilots Association stated that, at a minimum, the operator of a small UAS flying in controlled airspace should be required to monitor ATC frequency in the area in order to maintain situational awareness. The County of Los Angeles Department of Public Works recommended that FAA require small UAS operations to maintain two-way radio contact with ATC while operating in close proximity to an airport (airport influence area) or within Class B, C, or D airspace. PlaneSense and Cobalt Air similarly recommended that operators of small UAS operating in the airspace of an airport be required to have a radio to monitor air traffic at the airport and communicate with ATC. The Port of Los Angeles encouraged the FAA to consider requiring operators of small UAS to have two-way radio capability during all operations, not just those occurring in controlled airspace. The commenter noted the importance of radio communication between pilots, saying that the ability of small UAS operators to communicate with pilots of manned aircraft is particularly critical due to the relatively small size of the small unmanned aircraft and the difficulty pilots of manned aircraft may have in seeing and tracking small unmanned aircraft while airborne. The Colorado Agricultural Aviation Association also recommended a more general requirement for all UAS operators to be trained and equipped with an aviation radio.

The commenter also recommended detailed specifications for the radio transmitter. Another commenter asked FAA to consider requiring that all small UAS transmit their GPS location, speed, and direction of flight on a shared radio channel. The commenter noted that the FLARM system used by glider pilots is capable of transmitting this, and other, information. NAAA, PlaneSense, and Cobalt Air asserted that cost of radio equipment for small UAS is low.NAAA noted that UAS operators could obtain relatively low-cost ground-based radio equipment, as opposed to more costly aircraft\u0002mounted systems. PlaneSense and Cobalt Air similarly asserted that the cost of a hand-held radio is not so expensive as to override the safety benefits of requiring its use in airport airspace."

    "text":"Several commenters, including the Air Medical Operators Association, AirTractor, and CropLife America, recommended that FAA require small unmanned aircraft to be equipped with strobe lights to increase visibility. NAAA, Colorado Agricultural Aviation Association, Reabe Spraying, and Plu’s Flying Service recommended a strobe light requirement for both the small unmanned aircraft and its associated operator’s ground vehicle. GAMA suggested that FAA ‘‘undertake a specific review’’ to consider, among other things, ‘‘whether specific additional steps should be taken to increase visibility of small UAS for agricultural pilots,’’ including through the use of equipment such as strobe lights. Another commenter asserted that technology is commercially available to equip even the smallest UAS with an 8 gram LED strobe light, which can be powered off a ship’s battery beyond the duration of flight. Remote pilots can effectively see-and\u0002avoid other aircraft during daytime operations without an additional lighting requirement. By keeping the unmanned aircraft within visual line of sight of the remote pilot in command and visual observer with sufficient visibility, the remote pilot in command will be able to see the relatively large manned aircraft that may be entering the area of operation. The remote pilot in command will then have to give right of way to manned aircraft and ensure that the unmanned aircraft does not pose a hazard to aircraft operating nearby. While remote pilots are encouraged to make their aircraft as visible as possible, the diverse range of aircraft that may operate under part 107 make prescriptive lighting requirements for all types of operations impractical. Thus, as described in section III.E.2.c.i of this preamble, the FAA will only require lighting for small unmanned aircraft operating during periods of civil twilight. The Professional Helicopter Pilots Association suggested requiring small UAS to be equipped with a lighting system ‘‘intense enough to be visible during daylight and under bright sunlight conditions.’’ An individual stated that each UAS should have ‘‘identification beacon lights,’’ which are unique to UAS but similar to manned aircraft. The United States Ultralight Association said UAS should be required to have a ‘‘visual anti\u0002collision beacon’’ that will make the UAS visible for 3 miles during daylight operations. Due to the diverse nature of small unmanned aircraft, intense lighting systems may prove impractical in many cases due to weight and size limitations. As discussed in the previous section, the remote pilot in command is directly responsible for yielding the right of way to any manned aircraft and ensuring that the small unmanned aircraft will pose no undue hazard to other aircraft. Further, the remote pilot must fly the aircraft in such a way that the pilot or the visual observer is able to observe the airspace for other conflicting traffic. Because the remote pilot will have the ability to see and avoid other aircraft under the visual-line-of-sight framework of part 107, this rule will not require lighting during daytime operations. A few commenters recommended requirements for specific lighting color schemes. Two individuals recommended requiring green and red lights. One of those commenters noted that this is the standard for marine navigation lights, which enables other vessels to determine if a ship is approaching or departing and if it is moving left or right. arting and if it is moving left or right. The other commenter also recommended the use of white lights for landing and white flashing lights for emergency situations. Another individual asserted that hobbyists already use high-intensity LED and/or strobe lights for orientation assistance, and that blue and red provide the greatest contrast on small models."},

    "text":"Many commenters asserted that small unmanned aircraft may be difficult to see, both from the ground and from other aircraft operating in the NAS. For example, ALPA pointed out that many models of UAS are monochromatic or nearly so (either all black or all white), making them difficult to see against a non-contrasting background. The association urged FAA to develop conspicuity standards or advisory material discussing the factors influencing the ability to maintain visual contact. Another commenter stated that a commercial UAS is likely more difficult to see than other R/C model aircraft because model aircraft are usually painted with bright colors and flown in predictable locations. This commenter also said quadcopters and hexacopters, in particular, may be harder to see due to their ability to move very slowly and hover. The commenter added that these types of small unmanned aircraft are capable of climbing directly into the flight path of a manned aircraft, which may not see them because they are in an area obstructed by the nose of the manned aircraft. To resolve these issues, a number of commenters, including CoAAA, the California Agricultural Aircraft Association (CAAA), and the Permanent Editorial Board of the Aviators Model Code of Conduct Initiative, recommended a requirement for small unmanned aircraft to be coated in ‘‘highly visible’’ or ‘‘high visibility’’ colors to contrast them from surrounding airspace and the ground. NAAA argued that FAA should require colors that make the unmanned aircraft ‘‘readily distinguishable’’ from the background. NAAA pointed out that the FAA’s advisory circular on obstruction marking and lighting recommends ‘‘[a]lternate sections of aviation orange and white paint should be used as they provide maximum visibility of an obstruction by contrast in colors.’’ CAAA and Raebe also supported standardized markings of white and orange paint. Schertz Aerial Services recommended a paint scheme where the underside of the UAS is painted black, the top is painted mostly white, and at least two areas of the UAS are painted ‘‘florescent/aviation orange.’’ An individual suggested alternating aviation orange and red paint. Another individual recommended bright neon orange, red, or green. The FAA currently has no data indicating what color(s), if any, would enhance the conspicuity of small unmanned aircraft. Small unmanned aircraft operating under part 107 vary significantly by size, shape, and profile. As such, color patterns viable for one unmanned aircraft may not work for another unmanned aircraft. Additionally, contrasting colors cannot always be seen with varying light, weather, and cloud coverage, nor will specific colors always provide a contrasting effect. Very small unmanned aircraft also may not have the surface area or reflectivity to accept color patterns that would easily be seen by others not involved with the operation. Because of these considerations and in light of the fact that the risk of a midair collision is mitigated by the other provisions of this rule, the FAA will not require small unmanned aircraft to be painted in a specific color scheme. However, this rule does not restrict small UAS owners or remote pilots in command from painting a small UAS in a conspicuous manner if doing so would increase safety in their specific operating environment. The FAA will consider any conspicuity\u0002enhancing measures as a potential mitigation in support of an application for a waiver from the operating restrictions of part 107."

    "text":"With regard to the horizontal boundary of the confined area of operation, the visual-line-of-sight requirement discussed in section III.E.2.a of this preamble will create a natural horizontal boundary on the area of operation. Due to the distance limitations of human vision, the remote pilot in command or visual observer will be unable to maintain visual line of sight of the small unmanned aircraft sufficient to satisfy § 107.31 if the aircraft travels too far away from them. Accordingly, the visual-line-of-sight requirement in § 107.31 will effectively confine the horizontal area of operation to a circle around the person maintaining visual contact with the aircraft with the radius of that circle being limited to the farthest distance at which the person can see the aircraft sufficiently to maintain compliance with § 107.31. However, one way in which the horizontal area-of-operation boundary tied to the remote pilot in command’s line of sight could be expanded is for the remote pilot to be stationed on a moving vehicle or aircraft. If the remote pilot is stationed on a moving vehicle, then the horizontal area-of-operation boundary tied to the remote pilot’s lineof sight would move with the pilot, thus increasing the size of the small unmanned aircraft’s area of operation. To prevent this scenario, the NPRM proposed to prohibit the operation of a small UAS from a moving aircraft or land-borne vehicle. However, the FAA included an exception for water-borne vehicles in the NPRM reasoning that there are far fewer people and less property located on or over areas of water than on land. Consequently, a loss of positive control that occurs over water would present a significantly smaller risk of injuring a person or damaging property than a loss of positive control that occurs over land. For the reasons discussed below, this rule will maintain the proposed prohibition on operating a small UAS from a moving aircraft. This rule will, however, allow operation of a small UAS from a moving land-based or water-borne vehicle if the small unmanned aircraft is flown over a sparsely populated area.The prohibition against operating a small UAS from an aircraft and the limitations on operations from moving vehicles will be waivable as long as the small unmanned aircraft is not transporting another person’s property for compensation or hire. Several commenters, including ALPA, Aerius, and Drone User Group Network, concurred with the FAA that the operator should not be allowed to operate the small UAS from a moving vehicle or aircraft. NetMoby said the next generation of regulations can address this type of operation once a large database of information concerning the first generation of UAS operations has been developed. CAPA argued that the final rule should prohibit operation from all moving vehicles, including watercraft. The Professional Society of Drone Journalists stated that operations from any moving vehicle should only be permitted with special training and safeguards. A large number of other commenters, including MPAA, NAMIC, EEI, and MAPPS, specifically opposed a blanket prohibition on operations from moving land-based vehicles. AIA said that FAA should conduct ‘‘robust’’ risk analysis to determine if small UAS can be operated safely from moving land-based vehicles.

Because most manned aircraft operations take place higher than 500 feet above ground level (AGL), the NPRM proposed a 500-foot operating ceiling for small UAS operations.

Several commenters, including the Professional Photographers of America, ALPA, Boeing, Google, and State Farm, supported the 500-foot altitude limit proposed in the NPRM. Some noted that a 500-foot ceiling for UAS operations would strike a positive balance between flexibility for the UAS operator and the safety of manned aircraft operating in the NAS. Other commenters, including Barrick Gold of North America, argued that the altitude restrictions in the rule are unnecessary because the current airspace stratification and operating rules already provide the requisite level of safety. Barrick added, however, that it would support a buffer of 200 feet below the terminus of Class G airspace. An altitude limit for small UAS operations is necessary in this rule. Given the expected proliferation of small UAS in the NAS, and the safety implications for manned aircraft, the FAA must address the safe use of small UAS in the NAS. Moreover, Congress has directed the FAA to establish a regulatory framework to safely integrate small UAS operations into the NAS. Allowing unrestricted small unmanned aircraft to operate at high altitude without the benefit of additional equipment (for example, transponders and altimeters) and the provision of air traffic services introduces a significant threat of collision to manned aircraft operating in the NAS. Most manned aircraft operations transit the airspace at or above 500 feet AGL, and an altitude limitation provides a necessary barrier between small unmanned aircraft and a significant majority of manned aircraft operations in the NAS. However, as discussed below, this rule will make an exception to the altitude restriction for small UAS operations that are conducted close to a structure. Other commenters, including Northrop Grumman Corporation, AOPA, EAA, and HAI, recommended a reduction in the proposed 500-foot altitude limit. These commenters were concerned about the potential for conflict with manned aircraft operating in the NAS. The United States Ultralight Association and the U.S. Hang Gliding and Paragliding Association expressed general concern regarding the volume of manned aircraft traffic below 500 feet and the potential for collisions with small unmanned aircraft. While some commenters did not recommend a specific alternate maximum altitude, most that did favored a 400-foot operating ceiling. Commenters offered a variety of reasons to support a 400-foot altitude limit. One commenter justified a lower altitude by noting it is difficult for the operator to maintain visual contact with the small unmanned aircraft when operated above 500 feet, and a 400-foot limit would provide an added margin of safety. Most commenters stated that a 400-foot altitude limit would provide a reasonable buffer between UAS and manned aircraft operating in the NAS. NAAA remarked that recent narrowly averted collisions involving agricultural aircraft and UAS aircraft justify the establishment of a 400-foot limit. NAAA also noted the importance of the missions performed by aircraft at lower altitude, including agricultural and air ambulance operations."

Several commenters asserted that technology currently exists to allow for the safe operation of multiple small UAS by a single operator. The Mercatus Center at George Mason University said existing and developing technologies ‘‘can more than compensate to the diminished concentration that operators might apply to each individual aircraft.’’ AirShip Technologies stated that it currently incorporates technology that will allow clusters of UAS with similar missions to be pre-programmed and controlled by one operator. Boeing and Aviation Management similarly said that current technology allows a group or swarm of multiple vehicles to operate safely and efficiently in highly automated modes.

Vision Services Group said multiple small UAS operations should be permitted if both the operator and visual observer possess a Permit to Operate and a valid Third Class Medical Certificate. As discussed in the visual-line-of\u0002sight section of this preamble, the remote pilot in command, the person manipulating the flight controls of the small UAS, and the visual observer (if one is used) are required to maintain visual awareness of the small unmanned aircraft and the surrounding airspace in order to minimize the risk of a mid-air collision with a manned aircraft. This activity requires active attention and operating more than one unmanned aircraft at the same time would split the concentration of the small UAS crewmembers.of the small UAS crewmembers. By decreasing the amount of attention that the remote pilot in command, person manipulating the flight controls, and visual observer can dedicate to each small unmanned aircraft, the operation of multiple small unmanned aircraft at the same time may introduce additional risk into the NAS. This risk would further be compounded if larger numbers of aircraft are operated at the same time because each aircraft would receive an even smaller fraction of each person’s attention."

With these additional operating restrictions, the NPRM proposed to: (1) Allow micro UAS to fly over people not involved with the operation; and (2) create a separate airman certificate with a micro UAS rating. Many commenters addressing the issue supported the creation of a separate micro UAS classification, noting that the reduced regulatory requirements associated with the classification are consistent with the lower hazards posed by micro UAS.

Similarly, Foxtrot Consulting suggested that adequate training and a performance evaluation is a better mitigation measure because it ensures that remote pilots can operate their small UAS safely, regardless of what is below. The Small UAV Coalition, Aeromarine, and an individual commenter stated that the proposed prohibition is unduly restrictive because there is no prohibition on manned aircraft flying over people. The Coalition also asserted that, given the consequent reduction in risk associated with the visual-line-of-sight and see\u0002and-avoid requirements, a small UAS may safely be operated over persons. The International Center for Law and Economics and TechFreedom claimed that by prohibiting UAS operation over people who are not directly involved in the operation, the FAA is ‘‘essentially limiting commercial UAS operations to unpopulated or extremely sparsely populated areas,’’ and thus is ‘‘improperly ignor[ing] the important incentives for innovation suggested by Executive Order 12866 without apparent corresponding benefit.’’ The Consumers Energy Company (CEC) stated that the likelihood of injury from contact with a small UAS is low given the restrictions on the size of small UAS, as well as the fact that they use small rotors and carry small fuel loads. With respect to the maintenance of power lines, poles, and related facilities, in particular, CEC pointed out that most operations occur in remote or rural locations with low population densities, where the risk of contact between a small UAS and a non\u0002involved person is minimal. CEC said the FAA needs to consider ‘‘whether the risk perceived from small UAS usage really justifies a restriction that could have a substantial impact on the ability to use sUAS on a commercial scale.’’ o use sUAS on a commercial scale.’’ Manned aircraft are generally permitted to fly over people because manned aircraft are formally evaluated for airworthiness through the airworthiness certification process. This process ensures that the manned aircraft has a level of reliability that would allow it to, among other things, safely fly over a person. This rule does not require airworthiness certification. Because small unmanned aircraft have not been tested for reliability through the airworthiness certification process, they will likely have a higher failure rate than certificated aircraft."

Boeing asserted that the proposed rule imposes a requirement to assess risk, but provides no criteria against which to measure that risk. The commenter therefore recommended the FAA revise the proposed provision to include criteria to measure risk (e.g., reference the Structural Repair Manual (SRM) or similar criteria). The commenter also noted that there is no requirement to determine if the risk is acceptable, and recommended the FAA clarify this issue to ensure appropriate compliance with, and consistent interpretation of, the regulation. As discussed in the next section of this preamble, this rule will require the remote pilot in command to ensure that the small UAS will pose no undue hazard to other aircraft, people, or property in the event of a loss of control of the aircraft for any reason. Section 107.49 is intended to help the remote pilot in command satisfy this requirement by having the remote pilot in command assess the operating environment so that he or she can design the operation, as well as any mitigation, to ensure that the small unmanned aircraft does not create an undue hazard if positive control is lost. As a performance-based requirement, it is not the intent of this section to be prescriptive with regard to how remote pilots conduct an assessment of their operating environment. Because there is a diverse range of aircraft and operating environments that could exist for part 107 operations, a prescriptive preflight\u0002assessment standard may be more burdensome than necessary in some instances. For example, a remote pilot in command operating a small UAS in an empty rural area would not need to look at the same things to assure the safety of the operation as a remote pilot in command operating a small UAS in a crowded urban environment. The guidance material which the FAA has issued concurrently with this rule provides examples and best practices for how to conduct the preflight assessment of the operating area and assess risks that may affect the small UAS operation. The FAA will also consider publishing industry best practices in future small UAS guidance that will assist remote pilots in assessing risk. The Professional Helicopter Pilots Association said that, prior to flight, the remote pilot should be required to obtain a briefing, similar to a manned\u0002aircraft pilot’s briefing, which would include weather, NOTAMs, and any other pertinent information for the area in which they intend to operate. As discussed in sections III.E.2 and III.E.5 of this preamble, this rule includes requirements for assessing the operating environment with regard to weather and NOTAMs."

    "text":"The NPRM proposed that, after becoming familiar with the confined area of operation and conducting an operating environment assessment, the operator must ensure that the small unmanned aircraft will pose no undue hazard to other aircraft, people, or property in the event of a loss of positive control of the aircraft for any reason. The FAA proposed this performance-based requirement instead of a more prescriptive standard because it would provide the operator with significant flexibility to choose how to mitigate the hazards associated with loss of aircraft control. In a joint submission, PlaneSense and Cobalt Air stated that the language in proposed § 107.19(b) sets a different standard from that in § 107.23 (hazardous operation). They noted that while § 107.19(b) requires that small UAS operations ‘‘pose no undue hazard to other aircraft, people or property[,]’’ § 107.23(b) prohibits persons from operating a small UAS in a ‘‘careless or reckless manner so as to endanger the life or property of another[.]’’ The commenters argued that these two standards are not consistent, because § 107.23 does not include other aircraft within the scope of the third parties who must be protected. The commenters went on to say that these discrepancies create inconsistencies which result in incomplete guidance for the operators of small UAS, and may result in an increase in danger to the public. The commenters suggested that the appropriate standard is to be foundin § 107.19(b), and that § 107.23 should be changed to match it. Finally, the commenters asked the FAA to clarify whether ‘‘other aircraft’’ includes other unmanned aircraft. Part 107 prohibits a small UAS operation from endangering life or property, and prohibits a remote pilot from operating a small UAS in a careless or reckless manner. Property includes other aircraft, including other unmanned aircraft. These two requirements complement, rather than contradict, one another, and provide the remote pilot with the flexibility to adjust his or her operation according to the environment in which he or she is operating. For example, if the operation takes place in a residential area, the remote pilot in command could ask everyone in the area of operation to remain inside their homes while the operation is conducted. If the operation takes place in an area where other air traffic could pose a hazard, the remote pilot could advise local air traffic control as to the location of his or her area of operation and add extra visual observers to the operation so that they can notify the remote pilot if other aircraft are approaching the area of operation. These precautions would be one way to ensure that the operation will not pose an undue hazard to other aircraft, people or property in the event of a loss of control of the aircraft. Additionally, during the operation of the small unmanned aircraft, the remote pilot in command is prohibited from operating the aircraft in a careless and reckless manner, further ensuring that the operation does not pose an undue hazard to other aircraft, people, or property in the event of a loss of control of the aircraftThe NextGen Air Transportation Program, NC State University commented that § 107.19(b) is ‘‘not realistic.’’ The commenter stated that the remote pilot can do everything possible to minimize the risk and harm possible in the event of loss of positive control, but asserted that requiring that no damage be caused without requiring fly-away prevention or other risk management mechanisms does not align with the general NPRM objectives."

    "text":"Several commenters addressed the issue of autonomous operations of small UAS. An autonomous operation is generally considered an operation in which the remote pilot inputs a flight plan into the control station which sends it to the autopilot onboard the small unmanned aircraft. During automated flight, flight control inputs are made by components onboard the aircraft, not from a control station. Thus, the remote pilot in command could lose the control link to the small unmanned aircraft and the aircraft would still continue to fly the programmed mission or return home to land. During automated flight, the remote pilot in command also must have the ability to change routing/altitude or command the aircraft to land immediately. The ability to direct the small unmanned aircraft may be through manual manipulation of the flight controls or through commands using automation. For the reasons discussed below, this rule will allow autonomous small UAS operations. However, the remote pilot in command must retain the ability to direct the small unmanned aircraft to ensure compliance with the requirements of part 107. ALPA, the U.S. Hang Gliding & Paragliding Association, and the Permanent Editorial Board of the Aviators Model Code of Conduct Initiative asserted that the NPRM says autonomous operations would be permitted for small UAS, but then fails to discuss such operations further. ALPA generally opposed allowing autonomous operations for small UAS. The Permanent Editorial Board of the Aviators Model Code of Conduct Initiative said the NPRM’s mention of autonomous operations ‘‘requires explanation and context.’’ The U.S. Hang Gliding & Paragliding Association said it would be opposed to such operations ‘‘unless the operator has the ability to take positive control immediately and redirect the sUAS.’’ The Air Medical Operators Association raised concerns about the safety of ‘‘automated UAS,’’ saying that such aircraft do not have the capability to maintain the necessary separation from manned aircraft. The association acknowledged, as noted in the NPRM, that the many advancements in anti\u0002collision avoidance systems have been very effective in reducing the rate of mid-air collisions, but went on to say that the evidence of the effectiveness of such technology in preventing collisions between UAS and manned aircraft ‘‘would have to be overwhelming in order to alleviate the safety concerns of the low-altitude flying public.’’ Other commenters supported allowing autonomous operations for small UAS. Yale University recommended the final rule clarify that small UAS operators ‘‘may rely on autonomous or pre-programmed flight systems.’’ Streamline Designs also stated that autonomous operations should be permitted, adding that some commercial uses ‘‘may depend heavily on automatic, stabilized flight.’’ A number of individual commenters also supported autonomous operations. One such individual noted that there are situations where manual operations are more dangerous than automated operations, because computer controlled flight ‘‘can provide much greater control and safety by making corrective inputs on the order of hundreds of inputs per second.’’ The Property Drone Consortium recommended the final rule clarify what types of autonomous flights are permitted. The organization further recommended that autonomous flight be permitted without a need for the pilot/ operator to intervene, although the pilot/operator ‘‘would always have the ability to intervene.’’bility to intervene.’’ Several commenters suggested that autonomous operations be permitted in certain circumstances. LifeDrone, LLC sought a final rule that would specifically permit the autonomous operation of an emergency small UAS ‘‘that is initiated by an emergency signal along prearranged, low flight risk corridors at an altitude of 150 feet.’’"

    "text":"A geo-fence is a virtual barrier which may prevent the small unmanned aircraft from either entering or exiting a geographically defined area. The area may be defined by a property owner or aircraft operator utilizing a combination of mapping programs and technology such as global positioning system (GPS) or radio frequency identification (RFID). Such technology could restrict the small unmanned aircraft from flying in locations where a flight may be restricted for security, safety, or other reasons. The proposed rule did not establish geo-fencing equipment requirements for small UAS operating in the NAS. Instead, the NPRM proposed operational limitations such as requiring small UAS operators or visual observers to maintain visual line of sight in order to mitigate the risk of failure of the control link resulting in loss of positive control. After careful consideration of the comments, the FAA has decided not to add any geo-fencing equipment requirements in the final rule.

    "text":"The FAA initially considered requiring a flight termination system (FTS), which is a system that terminates the flight of a small UAS in the event that all other contingencies have been exhausted and further flight of the aircraft cannot be safely achieved, or other potential hazards exist that require immediate discontinuation of flight. However, the FAA determined that there are other viable alternatives that can achieve this goal without requiring an FTS. The NPRM invited comments as to the costs and benefits of requiring an FTS. After reviewing comments, the FAA has decided against requiring small UAS to include an FTS. Several commenters, including the Small UAV Coalition, the University of Arkansas Division of Agriculture, and Northrop Grumman, agreed with the NPRM that use of an FTS should not be mandatory. Southern Company stated that alternative operational measures would adequately mitigate loss of control risk. Two individuals argued that flight termination systems are too heavy for small UAS. The Oklahoma Governor’s Unmanned Aerial Systems Council commented that automatic termination of flight could have significant unintended consequences for the safety of people and property on the ground. NetMoby agreed that flight termination systems are not necessary, but encouraged the FAA to require return-to-home capabilities in UAS. Predesa also agreed that flight termination systems should not be required for small UAS, but asserted that GPS-based flight termination systems could mitigate risk. Planehook Aviation argued that the use of flight termination systems should be the operator’s decision. On the other hand, some commenters, including ALPA and EAA, among others, said the FAA should require small UAS to have flight termination systems. Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi/LSUASC and TTD said that a UAS without a flight termination system is dangerous to other users of the NAS if positive control is lost. The Professional Helicopter Pilots Association commented that this technology is already being included in most devices above the hobby level. NAAA said most of these technologies are software-based and utilize GPS systems already onboard the UAS and thus have no effect on the weight of the aircraft. Modovolate Aviation said the FAA should encourage small UAS stakeholders to develop performance standards for flight termination systems and require manufacturers to certify they have designed and manufactured their vehicles in accordance with these standards. The Aviation Division of the Washington State Department of Transportation, the Nez Perce Tribe and UPS generally felt that an FTS could be optional equipage but stopped short of supporting a mandate. One individual stated ‘‘. . . that if loss of control does occur, it can be easily mitigated by GPS based ‘return to home’ systems which take control of the craft and automatically fly it back to its launch point. The most widely available consumer quadcopter, the DJI Phantom 2, comes standard with this capability out of the box, and many hobbyists and commercial operators who build their own craft also install similar systems, which can be obtained for less than $100.’’ The NPRM mitigated the potential risk associated with UAS flight primarily through operational restrictions rather than airworthiness certification and equipage requirements, such as the installation of an FTS. If installed, an FTS may mitigate the risk associated with loss of positive control by having the unmanned aircraft execute intentional flight into terrain if the link between the remote pilot and the unmanned aircraft is severed. However, mandating equipage such as FTS would increase the costs of complying with this rule to address a safety risk that may be mitigated through low-cost operational parameters."

However, because small UAS operations subject to this rule pose a lower level of risk, there are operational alternatives available to mitigate their risk to an acceptable level without imposing an FAA requirement for technological equipage.

Therefore, this rule will not mandate the use of any kind of technological equipage or device. Modovolate Aviation recommended a general process for developing and integrating equipage requirements for small UAS. The commenter said it is important that the FAA ‘‘avoid anything resembling airworthiness and type certification for manned aircraft,’’ and instead ‘‘adapt the consensus standard approach used in the early days of occupational health and safety regulation and combine it with the performance standards approach used by the Federal Communications Commission for unlicensed wireless devices.’’ Modovolate Aviation explained that the FAA should encourage small UAS organizations to articulate performance standards for control technologies, and then manufacturers would certify that they have designed and manufactured their UAS in accordance with these consensus standards. The operating rules would require operators to confirm, as part of their pre-flight inspection, that these basic features are present and operating properly, and any manufacturers that falsely certify compliance with the standards would be subject to civil penalties and criminal prosecution for mail or wire fraud. As discussed in section III.J.3 of this preamble, the FAA has determined that airworthiness certification for small UAS operating within the limits set by part 107 is unnecessary. However, as noted by the commenter, the FAA encourages industry organizations to set voluntary standards for small UAS to further develop the industry. Such standards, however, would not relieve the remote pilot in command of his or her pre-flight responsibilities to determine that the system is in a condition for safe operation under §§ 107.15 and 107.49. That is because the remote pilot in command must ensure that the small UAS is in a condition for safe operation for each flight, which requires greater diligence as the small UAS ages. A number of commenters addressed the NPRM’s statement that ‘‘existing technology does not appear to provide a way to resolve the ‘see and avoid’ problem with small UAS operations without maintaining human visual contact with the small unmanned aircraft during flight.’’ CropLife America and Responsible Industry for a Sound Environment, commenting jointly, and the Professional Helicopter Pilots Association agreed with FAA that no see-and-avoid technology currently exists, but nevertheless said such technology should be required once it does become available. The United States Ultralight Association said UAS equipment should be designed with software or firmware that prevents the UAS from being flown further than one mile from the operator. The association asserted that ‘‘[d]epth perception fails well before that distance and one mile should be seen as the outside limit for safety.’’ The FAA recognizes that the use of software or firmware that prevents the UAS from being flown further than one mile could potentially help to prevent the small unmanned aircraft from flying out of the area of operation.

The FAA received approximately 15 comments in response to this proposed provision. CAPA and one individual commenter expressed concern about the proliferation of small UAS and their accessibility to persons with limited or no aviation experience. Both commenters asserted that it requires great skill to drop an object safely from an aircraft. CAPA also expressed concerns about the potential security risks of permitting objects to be dropped from small unmanned aircraft. Similarly, two individual commenters worried that small unmanned aircraft equipped for package delivery could be used to carry out terrorist activities, such as dropping canisters of poisonous gases into populated areas such as shopping malls. The FAA disagrees with the commenters that airmen operating under part 107 will lack the skill necessary to safely drop an object from a small UAS. As discussed in section III.E.1 of this preamble, all small UAS operations must be conducted either by a certificated remote pilot or under the direct supervision of a certificated remote pilot in command. In order to obtain a remote pilot certificate under part 107, an applicant will be required to demonstrate his or her knowledge of how to safely operate a small UAS under part 107.107 Thus, operations under part 107 will be conducted and overseen by certificated airmen who will have the knowledge necessary to safely conduct various part 107 operations, including safely dropping objects from a small UAS. With regard to dropping dangerous objects, the FAA notes that, as discussed in section III.C.1 of this preamble, this rule will prohibit the carriage of hazardous material by small unmanned aircraft. With regard to terrorism and criminal activities more broadly, as discussed in section III.J.2 of this preamble, there already exist criminal statutes that prohibit criminal and terrorist activities. Five commenters suggested that the language in the final rule regarding the dropping of objects should mirror the language in 14 CFR 91.15These commenters suggested that while proposed § 107.23(b) does not necessarily differ in substance from § 91.15, it should be made explicit that the rule does not prohibit the dropping of any object if reasonable precautions are taken to avoid injury or damage to persons or property. DJI suggested that the FAA adopt the ‘‘hazard to persons or property’’ standard used in § 91.15 for external load and towing operations. Section 91.15 prohibits an object from being dropped from an aircraft in flight in a manner that creates a hazard to persons or property. Section 107.19(b) of this rule uses a similar standard of ‘‘undue hazard’’ with regard to loss of positive control of a small unmanned aircraft. In order to promote regulatory consistency throughout part 107, the FAA has rephrased the regulatory text of § 107.23(b) to use the ‘‘undue hazard’’ standard specified in § 107.19(b). The revised § 107.23(b) will prohibit dropping objects from a small unmanned aircraft in a manner that creates an undue hazard to persons or property. DJI noted that the term ‘‘hazard’’ is inherently subjective. DJI acknowledged that ‘‘it may be impossible to adopt a non-subjective standard,’’ and requested that the FAA provide guidance on the types of operations that the FAA would consider to be hazardous."

    "text":"The NPRM proposed prohibiting small UAS operations in Class A airspace. Class A airspace starts at 18,000 feet mean sea level and extends up to 60,000 feet.111 This rule will not adopt the proposed prohibition because a small unmanned aircraft will be unable to access Class A airspace without violating the other operational restrictions of part 107. The Mid-Atlantic Aviation Partnership, Crew Systems, and three individual commenters questioned the need for specifically prohibiting operations in Class A airspace. One of the individual commenters did not have an objection to the proposed restriction, but stated that the other operational restrictions in the NPRM would make it impossible to operate in Class A airspace. Another individual commenter pointed out that the only location where an operation could meet all of the operational restrictions proposed in the NPRM and still be in Class A airspace is near the summit of Mt. McKinley. This commenter suggested that an explicit restriction on Class A airspace operations was unnecessary, as no one would bother to carry a small UAS up a mountain in order to fly it. The FAA agrees with the commenter who stated that other operational restrictions in the NPRM would make it impossible to operate in Class A airspace. Title 14 CFR 71.33(b) designating Class A airspace in Alaska specifically excludes the airspace less than 1,500 feet above the surface of the earth. This eliminates the possibility of a small UAS operating under part 107 from reaching Class A airspace given the altitude limitations of the rule. Consequently, this rule will not adopt the proposed Class A airspace restriction. c. Prohibited or Restricted Areas The NPRM proposed prohibiting small UAS operations in prohibited and restricted areas without permission from the using or controlling agency, as applicable.

However, four commenters also cited safety concerns when suggesting that the FAA establish such restrictions. Southern Company and Edison Electric Institute, individually and jointly with NRECA and APPA, explicitly cited safety reasons for restricting operations near energy infrastructure facilities. Edison Electric Institute raised concerns regarding UAS operations over critical energy infrastructure, including electric transmission and distribution facilities, power generation facilities, transmission lines, and substations. The commenter noted that the FAA currently has a TFR for manned aircraft over generation facilities, which the commenter said should be extended to cover UAS. The commenter argued that the FAA should extend the TFR to small UAS because of ‘‘the obvious safety factor involved with any activity near high voltage equipment and the attendant economic loss that comes from the possible loss of electric distribution.’’ EEI also submitted a separate, joint comment with NRECA and the APPA, which reiterated the same concerns. Southern Company proposed that the FAA prohibit small UAS operations over power generation and transmission facilities, except by the utility or third parties acting on behalf of the utility. "

    "text":"The NPRM proposed to prohibit operation of small UAS in airspace restricted by NOTAMs, including NOTAMs issued to designate a TFR, unless authorized by ATC or a certificate of waiver or authorization. After reviewing comments on this issue, the FAA will change the method by which remote pilots may gain permission to operate in airspace restricted by NOTAMs. The final rule will require that small UAS operators comply with the provisions of §§ 91.137 through 91.145, and § 99.7, as applicable. Southern Company commented that electric utility companies should be excepted from TFRs under §§ 91.137(a)(2) and (a)(3) to be able to expeditiously restore power during natural disasters. The Washington State Department of Transportation, Aviation Division, recommended that small UAS be allowed to operate in airspace restricted by NOTAMs, including TFRs,if the aircraft is equipped with position\u0002reporting transmission capability, if two-way communication can be maintained between the operator and ATC, and if the appropriate level of permission to enter the airspace has been obtained. TFRs are implemented for a number of reasons, from protecting aircraft from hazards on the ground or other sight\u0002seeing aircraft, to providing a safe environment for the operation of disaster relief aircraft. The Washington State Department of Transportation, Aviation Division, did not describe how a UAS equipped with position-reporting transmission capability and two-way radio communication would allow for safe operation in a TFR. NOTAMs contain time-critical aeronautical information that is either temporary in nature or not sufficiently known in advance to permit publication on aeronautical charts or other publications.114 NOTAMs are available to the public on the FAA’s Web site.115 In response to Southern Company’s comment, the FAA notes that NOTAMs exist to address hazards in the restricted airspace, and allowing an aircraft to enter TFRs based only on its mission does not address the hazard that warranted the airspace restriction. However, these comments raise the question of whether the proposed rule needlessly conflicted with the NOTAM provisions in part 91. Part 91 contains various types of NOTAMs, and the requirements to gain permission differ accordingly. For example, § 91.137(b) requires an aircraft to be participating in hazard relief activities under the direction of the official in charge of on\u0002scene emergency response activities in order to operate within an area for which the specified NOTAM has been issued.116 Section 91.137(c) contains a number of conditions, at least one of which must be met in order to operate within an area for which the specified NOTAM has been issued.117 Conditions under § 91.137(c) include that the aircraft be carrying law enforcement or media personnel, or the aircraft is operating under an ATC-approved IFR flight plan.118 Conversely, a § 91.141 TFR in the proximity of Presidential and other parties has no exceptions other than those stated in the NOTAM.119These provisions conflict with the proposed language in the NPRM that would allow operations in airspace restricted by NOTAM with ATC or COA permission. In considering this issue, the FAA has identified no UAS-specific concerns that would require treating small UAS differently, for TFR purposes, than aircraft operating under part 91. Thus, the FAA has amended the language of § 107.47 to require compliance with §§ 91.137 through 91.145 or § 99.7. Additionally, the FAA notes that part 91 subpart J lists the provisions under part 91 that are waivable, and describes the process to request a waiver.120 Because small UAS remote pilots will be subject to the part 91 provisions described above, the waiver provisions and process described in part 91 subpart J will also apply should a remote pilot wish to seek a waiver from the applicable part 91 provisions."

    "text":"The FAA did not include any discussion of airports in Class G airspace in the NPRM and it did not propose any regulatory text to restrict small UAS operations in the vicinity of airports in class G airspace. Class G airspace is considered uncontrolled and ATC does not have authority or responsibility for separation of traffic. For operations in the vicinity of non\u0002towered airports located in class E surface areas, the remote pilot in command must obtain prior permission from Air Traffic Control. After further review, the FAA will include a provision in the final rule that prohibits any small unmanned aircraft operations that interfere with operations and traffic patterns at any airport, heliport, or seaplane base. Several commenters, including Trimble Navigation and NAMIC, supported allowing operations in class G airspace, without additional comment regarding operations in the vicinity of airports in class G. AOPA and GAMA recommended prohibiting small UAS operations within a minimal accepted horizontal distance from airports in Class G airspace, but they did not recommend a specific distance. NBAA suggested that FAA restrict operations within a 3-mile radius of airports in class G airspace. The Airline Pilots Association and Hillsborough County Aviation Authority recommended restricting operations within a 5-mile radius of airports. Several individual commenters also recommended a prohibition of small UAS in the vicinity of airports. The FAA agrees with commenters that supported the integration of small UAS operations with existing aeronautical operations in uncontrolled class G airspace because part 107 has specific risk mitigation and hazard reduction provisions that facilitate integration. First, small UAS pilots will be required to pass initial aeronautical knowledge testing before receiving a part 107 airman certificate. This knowledge testing will include operations in class G airspace. With issuance of the remote pilot certificate, the pilot will have the authority and responsibility of a remote pilot in command. The remote pilot in command will also be directly responsible for, and will be the final authority as to the operation of the small unmanned aircraft system. Finally, the remote pilot in command will be required to ensure that the small unmanned aircraft will pose no undue hazard to other aircraft, people, or property in the event of a loss of control of the aircraft for any reason. The FAA acknowledges, however, that there is a risk associated with close operations between manned and unmanned aircraft. Therefore, this rule will include a performance-based approach to integrating small unmanned aircraft near airports, heliports, and seaplane bases. Because the NPRM did not contemplate prohibiting operations within the vicinity of an airport in class G airspace, the FAA will not restrict small UAS operations within a specified distance from an airport. Rather, in response to concerns regarding the integration of small UAS and manned aircraft, this rule will prohibit remote pilots from operating their small unmanned aircraft in a manner that interferes with operations and traffic patterns at airports, heliports, and seaplane bases. While a small unmanned aircraft must always yield right of way to a manned aircraft, a manned aircraft may alter its flight path or delay its landing or take off in order to avoid a small UAS that may present a potential conflict or otherwise affect the safe outcome of the flight. For example, an unmanned aircraft hovering 200 feet above a runway may cause a manned aircraft holding short of the runway to delay take off, or a manned aircraft on the downwind leg of the pattern to delay landing."

    "text":"As discussed in section III.J.3 of this preamble, pursuant to section 333(b)(2) of Public Law 112–95, the FAA has determined that a small UAS will not be required to obtain airworthiness certification if satisfying the provisions of part 107. However, without an airworthiness certification process, the FAA still needs to provide criteria for small UAS to meet that support safe operations. In considering how to address this issue, the FAA notes that existing regulations applicable to manned civil aircraft require particular U.S. airworthiness certificated aircraft to be inspected every 12 months.124 Maintenance that might be necessary as a result is governed primarily by the provisions of 14 CFR part 43. Part 43 requires that the inspection examine every system and component of the aircraft in detail to identify present conditions that may render the aircraft as unairworthy.125 If the inspection reveals any hazardous characteristics that would render the aircraft as unairworthy, then maintenance, conducted pursuant to the regulations of part 43, must be performed in order to approve the return of an aircraft to an airworthy condition. In place of the requirements of part 43, the NPRM proposed to create a maintenance and inspection framework that corresponds with the significantly reduced risk posed by small UAS operations conducted under part 107. First, the NPRM proposed to require, in § 107.21, that the operator must maintain the small UAS in a condition for safe operation and inspect the small UAS prior to each flight to determine it is in a condition for safe operation. Second, the NPRM proposed to prohibit a person from operating a small UAS unless that UAS is in a condition for safe operation. Third, the NPRM proposed to require the operator to discontinue the flight of the small unmanned aircraft when he or she knows or has reason to know that continuing the flight would pose a hazard to other aircraft, people, or property. Finally, to reduce the possibility of a malfunctioning control link, the NPRM proposed to require that, prior to flight, the operator must ensure that all links between the control station and the small unmanned aircraft are functioning properly. For the reasons discussed below, this rule will require the remote pilot in command to check the small UAS to determine whether it is in a condition for safe operation. The remote pilot will be prohibited from commencing flight if the small UAS is not in a condition for safe operation. Additionally, the remote pilot in command will be required to discontinue the flight of the small unmanned aircraft if he or she knows or has reason to know that the small UAS is no longer in a condition for safe operation.

However, several commenters proposedchanges to the requirement or requested clarification regarding what the inspection should entail. Two individual commenters expressed opposition to the preflight inspection requirement and suggested that the requirement is burdensome or unnecessary. One individual commented that it would be impractical to perform a meaningful inspection before every flight, since many UAS flights last only a few minutes each, and there is a need to minimize delay between flights. That commenter proposed instead that the FAA require only one thorough pre-flight inspection prior to the first flight of the day, and that the first flight of the day should be a test flight. Another individual commenter said a preflight inspection before every flight ‘‘could become a hassle and may be unnecessary,’’ and that a monthly inspection would be more suitable. This rule will require the remote pilot in command to conduct a preflight check prior to each flight to determine if the small UAS is in a condition for safe operation. An integral ground functional check as part of the preflight inspection will include a check of the associated data link equipment for proper operation.

A complete inspection of the aircraft and associated system equipment will include a functional ground check as a test to verify all control link systems are properly responding to control inputs and are otherwise functioning properly. The systems and equipment that could be checked in this manner could, depending on the complexity of the small UAS, include the engine, flight controls, landing gear, internal/external payload, link checks, ground control station, signal flow, auxiliary equipment rack, video dissemination, power requirements, and software configuration management.

Several organizations, including DJI, Predesa, State Farm and the Small UAV Coalition, supported the provision as proposed. On the other hand, the University of North Dakota’s John D. Odegard School of Aerospace Sciences and an individual commenter suggested that the term ‘‘hazard’’ in this context should be qualified as it is in § 107.19(b), which uses the phrase ‘‘undue hazard.’’ These commenters suggested that § 107.15(b) should be amended for consistency, in part, to read ‘‘. . . pose an undue hazard to other aircraft, people, or property.’’ (Emphasis added). The FAA agrees with the University of North Dakota and the individual commenter that the term ‘‘hazard’’ in proposed § 107.15(b) is inconsistent with the standard of ‘‘undue hazard’’ in § 107.19. In considering how to address this issue, the FAA noted that § 107.15(b) is intended to address instances in which a small UAS that is in a condition for safe operation during the preflight check ceases being in a condition for safe operation after flight commences. Accordingly, the FAA has amended § 107.15(b) to reflect the fact that the pertinent standard is ‘‘condition for safe operation’’ and not ‘‘hazard.’’ AIA suggested that the FAA should define the timing of the discontinuation of flight if the small UAS ceases being in a condition for safe operation. AIA suggested that the requirement should be to terminate flight ‘‘as soon as practicable.’’ In response, the FAA notes that, if a small UAS should cease being in a condition for safe operation during flight, the remote pilot in command must immediately discontinue the flight by landing the small unmanned aircraft at the first available location where the landing can be conducted safely. iii.

DJI and Qualcomm supported the proposed requirement, without further comment. ALPA also supported the proposed requirement, but then recommended an additional requirement to verify the usable range of the transmitter in the control station before a flight. Transport Canada questioned whether the FAA has considered requiring the UAS operator to check for radio interference during the preflight inspection. The NextGen Air Transportation Program at NC State University argued that the proposed requirement should include ‘‘something about spectrum management/approvals.’’This rule will require the remote pilot in command to ensure that all links between the control station and the small unmanned aircraft are working properly."

For the reasons discussed below, the FAA will finalize this provision as proposed in the NPRM. One commenter stated that § 107.23 must have the same force and effect as 14 CFR 91.13. Two commenters said that ‘‘careless and reckless’’ is a vague and subjective standard, with one stating that it is unenforceable unless the FAA describes concretely what constitutes careless or reckless behavior. Section 107.23(a) will prohibit a person from operating a small UAS in a careless or reckless manner so as to endanger the life or property of another. This provision is derived from a similar prohibition on careless/reckless conduct that currently exists for manned aircraft in § 91.13(a), and as such, the FAA expects that these two provisions will have similar effects. The determination of whether conduct is careless or reckless is made on a case-by-case basis through NTSB caselaw. The FAA has issued guidance (FAA Order 8900.1, vol. 14, ch. 3, sec. 5) summarizing the pertinent caselaw, which provides illustrative examples of conduct that is considered to be careless or reckless. One commenter suggested that the FAA should permit local law enforcement authorities to enforce the prohibition against careless or reckless operations. In response, the FAA notes that, as discussed in section III.I of this preamble, the FAA cannot delegate its formal enforcement functions. One commenter asked the FAA to clarify what evidence would be used to prove that a remote pilot operated in a careless or reckless manner. Another commenter suggested that a flight data recorder be required to facilitate the enforcement of the prohibition against careless or reckless operations. A flight data recorder requirement would add cost, complexity, and weight to small unmanned aircraft without a corresponding incremental safety benefit. The FAA notes that enforcement of violations will be similar to enforcement conducted for part 91 operations: In addition to conducting routine surveillance of part 107 operations, the FAA will act on reports of violations to conduct further investigations.

The Small UAV Coalition, the Aviation Division of Washington State Department of Transportation, and three individuals generally supported the provisions related to drugs and alcohol. One commenter asserted that the FAA proposed no requirement about the condition of the operator, such as illness or impairment by drugs or alcohol, and that small UAS remote pilots should be required to self-certify that they are in a condition that enables them to safely operate a small UAS. The FAA clarifies that this rule does not allow operation of a small UAS if the remote pilot in command, visual observer, or the person manipulating the flight controls of a small UAS is unable to safely operate the small UAS due to drug or alcohol impairment. As discussed previously, this rule will, among other things, require these people to comply with the provisions of § 91.17. With regard to non-drug or alcohol impairment, such as an illness, the FAA notes that, as discussed in section III.F.2.c of this preamble, a person may not act as a remote pilot in command or visual observer or manipulate the flight controls of a small UAS if he or she knows or has reason to know that he or she has a physical or mental condition that would interfere with the safe operation of a small UAS.

Cherokee Nation Technologies commented that over-the-counter medications could impair the ability to safely operate a small UAS. The FAA agrees with this comment and notes that over-the-counter medications are addressed by the provisions of this rule. Specifically, § 91.17(a)(3) prohibits the use of any drug that affects the person’s faculties in any way contrary to safety. The University of North Dakota’s John D. Odegard School of Aerospace Sciences commented that the contents of §§ 91.17 and 91.19, which are cross\u0002referenced in proposed part 107, should be included in their entirety in proposed part 107 to enable ease of reading and understanding the regulations.

Several commenters, including DJI, ALPA, and Qualcomm, supported the FAA’s proposal. On the other hand, the Kansas State University UAS Program, Center for Robot-Assisted Search and Rescue, Consumers Energy Company and an individual generally noted that some UAS have very short battery lives. One commenter asserted that some small UAS have only five minutes of total available flight time. Commenters suggested that a small UAS should simply be required to have enough available power to operate for its intended time and then land safely, which could require significantly less than five minutes of total power. The FAA concurs with commenters who suggested that a small UAS should be required to have enough available power to operate for its intended operational time and then land safely. As discussed in section III.E.3.a of this preamble, small UAS operations conducted under this rule will operate in a confined area of operation. As a result of this confined area, the prohibition of operations over people, and due to the defined weight of the small unmanned aircraft, small UAS operations conducted under part 107 will generally pose a low risk as compared to manned aircraft. As such, a requirement for an additional five minutes of power is unnecessary. The FAA acknowledges that some small unmanned aircraft flights may be conducted for very short durations at very low altitudes, and the need for a larger battery to provide an additional five-minute power reserve may significantly limit those operations without a corresponding safety benefit. Several commenters suggested different approaches other than the requirement for five minutes of additional power. Embry-Riddle and several individual commenters generally noted that different small UAS have differing amounts of power and flight time available. These commenters suggested that a requirement that is based on a 10% reserve of power would better accommodate small UAS of differing design, equipment, and performance standards. The Center for Robot-Assisted Search and Rescue suggested that the reserve power requirement be based on the distance needed for the aircraft to return to the remote pilot.

    "text":"The NPRM proposed establishing eligibility requirements for a part 107 airman certificate and specifying when a certificate would be issued. The NPRM proposed that an applicant must be: (1) At least 17 years of age; (2) able to read, speak, write and understand the English language; and (3) vetted by the Transportation Security Administration. Additionally, the NPRM proposed that the applicant must pass an initial aeronautical knowledge test and self\u0002certify, at the time of application, that he or she does not have a medical condition that could interfere with the safe operation of a small UAS. As discussed in more detail below, the process for issuance of a remote pilot certificate will be as follows. First, an applicant will have to take and pass an initial aeronautical knowledge test. After taking the knowledge test, the applicant will be provided with an airman knowledge test report showing his or her test results. If the applicant passed the test, the applicant will then fill out an application for a remote pilot certificate using either the FAA’s electronic application process (referred to as the Integrated Airman Certification and Rating Application (IACRA) system) or a paper application. The FAA will then forward the applicant’s information to the TSA for security vetting to determine whether the applicant poses a security risk. Once TSA notifies the FAA that the applicant does not pose a security risk the FAA will issue an electronic temporary remote pilot certificate to an applicant who applied through the IACRA system.128 This temporary certificate (valid for 120 days after receipt) will be issued within 10 business days after receipt of an electronic application, and it will allow the applicant to exercise all the privileges of a remote pilot certificate with a small UAS rating. Once all other FAA-internal processing is complete, the FAA will issue the applicant a permanent remote pilot certificate. Holders of a part 61 pilot certificate other than student pilot who have completed a flight review within the previous 24 months will have the option of a different certification process. These pilot certificate holders will be allowed to substitute completion of an online training course for the small UAS aeronautical knowledge test. Upon completion of the training course, the part 61 pilot certificate holder will then go to one of the following authorized portals: An FAA Flight Standards District Office (FSDO), a designated pilot examiner (DPE), an airman certification representative (ACR) for a pilot school, or a certificated flight instructor (CFI). The certificate holder will provide his or her remote pilot certificate application and supporting documentation to that portal to verify the applicant’s identity, fill out the pertinent portion of the application, and then forward the completed application to the FAA Airman Certification Registry. Because a part 61 pilot certificate holder has already been vetted by TSA, he or she will be issued a temporary remote pilot certificate with a small UAS rating, valid for 120 days, immediately upon the FAA’s receipt of the completed application via IACRA. Once all other processing is complete, the FAA will issue a permanent remote pilot certificate. The FAA emphasizes that part 61 pilot certificate holders are not required to use the process discussed in the previous paragraph and can instead apply for a remote pilot certificate by taking the small UAS initial aeronautical knowledge test.

    "text":"The NPRM proposed that a person must be at least 17 years of age to be eligible for a remote pilot airman certificate with a small UAS rating. This minimum age would be consistent with existing FAA minimum age requirements for the sport pilot, recreational pilot, and private pilot airman certificates with an airplane or rotorcraft rating. The FAA also invited comment on whether to adopt a minimum age of 16 years, which would be consistent with existing FAA minimum age requirements for the sport pilot and private pilot airman certificates with a glider or balloon rating. After review of the comments, the FAA adopts a minimum age of 16 for a person to be eligible for a remote pilot certificate with a small UAS rating. Fourteen commenters, including the Small UAV Coalition, AUVSI, and NAMIC, all agreed that the proposed minimum age of 17 generally strikes an appropriate balance between safety and operational viability for low risk small UAS operations, ensuring that baseline safety is enhanced without unduly burdening low risk small UAS operators or their operations. These commenters argued that the NPRM’s proposal is consistent with the requirements for other pilot certificates and, at this time, there is a lack of data and evidence to support lowering the age to 16. The commenters added that although persons under the age of 17 are already allowed to operate model aircraft, it is unclear if there is a strong need for allowing younger remote pilots to operate non-hobby and non-recreational small UAS. University of North Dakota’s John D. Odegard School of Aerospace Sciences added that 16-year-old student pilots are accompanied or monitored by an instructor, whereas, a small UAS operator would effectively be unmonitored. Federal Airways & Airspace also agreed with limiting the certification age to 17 years old, and pointed out that the National Institute of Mental Health has stated on their Web site that the rate of death by any injury of those aged 15 to 19 years old is six times higher than that for individuals aged 10 to 14 years old. Federal Airways & Airspace also mentioned that studies have shown that the human brain does not reach maturity until the early 20s, and the CDC states that those aged 16 to 19 are almost three times more likelythan 20-year-olds to be in a fatal motor vehicle accident. Several commenters recommended raising the minimum age above 17. Commenters including the General Aviation Manufacturers Association (GAMA), Textron Systems, and Aerius Flight, recommended an 18-year-old eligibility requirement for small UAS operators, because it aligns with existing airman certification standards for other commercial flight operations. One commenter asserted that 18 is the appropriate age for an operator certificate because it is the age at which an individual is an adult and able to enter into legally binding contracts. The Air Line Pilots Association and Transportation Trades Department, AFL–CIO said small UAS operators should hold a commercial pilot certificate, and should therefore be a minimum of 18 years old. Several commenters recommended the minimum age requirement be raised even higher, to 21 or 25 years old.Conversely, 36 commenters, including NBAA, AIA, and the Kansas Farm Bureau, argued that the minimum age should be lowered to 16. One commenter asserted that: (1) Flying a manned aircraft is considerably more complex than operating a small UAS; and (2) a small UAS has no people on board who would be injured in the event of an accident. Many other individuals argued that because of all the operating constraints contemplated by the NPRM, a 16-year-old should be able to safely operate a small UAS without exposing anyone to undue risk.Nine commenters asserted that a minimum age of 16 would also align with current requirements for glider and balloon pilots."

    "text":"In the NPRM, the FAA proposed to require that applicants for a part 107 airman certificate be able to read, speak, and understand the English language. These proposed English-language requirements would be consistent with all other airman certificates issued by the FAA, as well as the international standard for aircraft operations accepted by ICAO. However, the FAA also proposed an exception for people who are unable to meet one of the English\u0002language requirements due to medical reasons. Such a person would be eligible for a certificate, but the FAA would be able to specify limitations on the certificate to account for that person’s medical condition. Five commenters expressed support for requiring airman-certificate applicants to be able to read, speak, and understand the English language. There were no comments opposing this aspect of the proposal. Accordingly, this rule will require that applicants for an airman certificate be able to read, speak, and understand the English language.Three commenters opposed the proposed exception to the English\u0002language requirements. One of these commenters stated that there should be no exceptions to the English-language requirement, while another commenter stated that there should be no exception for persons whose medical reasons would preclude them from effectively communicating procedures or reading flight logs. A third commenter stated that a person who cannot speak English should not be permitted to operate anywhere near people on the ground because that person would be unable to communicate safety-relevant information to people in the vicinity of the operation. Limiting the exception for the English-language requirements of this rule would impose a needless burden on airman-certificate applicants who have a medical condition. Specifically, if an applicant cannot read, speak, or understand the English language, the proposed exception would allow the FAA to impose restrictions on that applicant’s certificate ensuring that the person’s English-language inability does not adversely affect safety. For example, if an applicant is unable to communicate using speech, then the FAA may restrict that applicant’s certificate to operations where speech is not necessary for the safe operation of a small UAS. Restrictions issued under this provision will be specific to each applicant, and as such, the FAA cannot make the categorical statements suggested by the commenters as to what will or will not be permitted for applicants with a specific English\u0002language inability. The FAA notes that its English-language regulations for other airman certificates have a similar exception for applicants who have a medical issue,134 and the FAA has not observed any adverse safety effects from having this exception in the regulations. Accordingly, this final rule will retain the proposed exception for people who are unable to meet one of the English language requirements due to a medical condition. 14 CFR 107.61(b). However, the FAA emphasizes that, as with other airmen, it may specify limitations on a person’s airman certificate to ensure that the person’s medical condition does not endanger the safety of the NAS."

The FAA received approximately 115 comments from organizations and individuals on this subject. Several commenters stated than an airman medical certificate is not necessary to operate a UAS. Other commenters suggested adding a requirement for an airman medical certificate. The FAA disagrees that a medical certificate should be required in this rule. With certain exceptions, the FAA currently requires an airman medical certificate for exercising the privileges of a student pilot certificate, a recreational pilot certificate, a private pilot certificate, a commercial pilot certificate, and an airline transport pilot certificate.135 The primary reason for medical certification is to determine if the airman has a medical condition that is likely to manifest as subtle or sudden incapacitation that could cause a pilot to lose control of the aircraft, or impair the pilot’s ability to ‘‘see and avoid.’’ Small UAS operations present a lower risk than manned operations to manned aircraft and non-participating people on the ground, especially because the operations do not involve any human beings onboard the aircraft who could be injured in the event of an accident. Additionally, unlike manned-aircraft operations, remote pilots and visual observers will be operating within a confined area of operation, subject to operational limitations intended to minimize the exposure of the small unmanned aircraft to manned aircraft in flight and people on the ground. Because of these operational limitations, traditional FAA medical certification is not warranted for remote pilots or visual observers. The FAA also notes that the risks associated with pilot incapacitation are similar to the risks associated with loss of positive control. As discussed in that section, risks associated with loss of positive control are mitigated in this rule through: (1) Preflight inspection of the control links, (2) a speed limit of 87 knots, and (3) a prohibition on operations of small unmanned aircraft over people not directly participating in the operation. Just as § 107.49(a)(3) will require remote pilots to ensure that all links between ground station and the small unmanned aircraft are working properly, § 107.17 will require the remote pilot in command to abstain from small UAS operations if he or sheknows or has reason to know that he or she has a physical or mental condition that would interfere with the safe operation of the flight. Federal Airways & Airspace, ALPA, and several individual commenters expressed concern about the lack of a required vision exam. General Aviation Manufacturers Association and Aerospace Industries Association suggested that remote pilots hold a valid U.S. driver’s license to ensure a basic eye exam. The FAA considers the visual-line-of\u0002sight requirement for the remote pilot, the person manipulating the flight controls of the small UAS (if that person is not the remote pilot), and the visual observer (if one is used) to be able to see the aircraft’s direction, altitude, and attitude of flight to be preferable to a prescriptive vision standard. Even with normal vision, it is foreseeable that a small unmanned aircraft may be so small that the operational space must be reduced t meet the visual-line-of-sight requirements of § 107.31o."

However, the FAA invited comments on whether flight proficiency or aeronautical experience should be required. For the reasons discussed below, this rule will not require applicants for a remote pilot certificate with a small UAS rating to demonstrate flight proficiency or aeronautical experience. Several commenters, including NBAA, Colorado Cattlemen’s Association, and NetMoby, agreed with the NPRM that the FAA should not require small UAS operators to demonstrate their proficiency in operating a small UAS prior to obtaining an operator certificate. These commenters reasoned that requiring a proficiency test is unnecessary because small UAS are not very difficult to operate and the test could be cost prohibitive for some operators. NetMoby added that there will be a market incentive for manufacturers to ensure that future operators are capable of flying their UAS. Other commenters, including the AFL–CIO, AIA, and NAAA, disagreed with the proposal and suggested that the FAA require small UAS operators to demonstrate their proficiency in operating a small UAS prior to obtaining a remote pilot certificate. Some of the commenters asserted that this would be consistent with testing requirements used for part 61 pilot certificates. Aviation Management and Modovolate Aviation suggested requiring a practical test or demonstration of aeronautical knowledge for certain aircraft or flying conditions (e.g., those weighing more than 4.4 pounds, operation beyond visual line-of-sight), but not for others (e.g., micro UAS, operation in only Class G airspace). Virginia Commonwealth University Honors Students suggested that separate tests should be required for each type of small UAS. As discussed in section III.E.3.a of this preamble, small UAS operations conducted under this rule will operate in a confined area of operation. As a result of this confined area and due to the very low weight of the small unmanned aircraft, small UAS operations conducted under part 107 will generally pose a very low risk as compared to manned aircraft. As such, flight proficiency and aeronautical experience requirements (which apply to part 61 pilots) are unnecessary for remote pilots of a small UAS. Flight proficiency testing is also not necessary for small UAS operations because, unlike a manned aircraft pilot, the remote pilot of a small UAS can easily terminate flight at any point. The light weight and lack of people onboard the small unmanned aircraft provides the remote pilot of that aircraft with a multitude of safe landing options. The remote pilot also has the option to sacrifice the small unmanned aircraft because there are no people onboard who would be endangered by that action. Conversely, a manned aircraft can only land at a location that can safely accommodate its large weight. The landing of a manned aircraft must also be accomplished in a manner that does not endanger the people onboard the aircraft. Because of the ease with which the flight of a small unmanned aircraft can be terminated and because of the overall low risk posed by small UAS operations that will be conducted under part 107, this rule will not include practical testing or flight experience requirements for a remote pilot certificate."

After reviewing the comments, the FAA has determined that it will not impose any specific training or flight instruction requirements for small UAS remote pilot certificate applicants. Many commenters, including NAFI, NAAA, and A4A, stated that the FAA should require individuals to attend a training course before obtaining a small UAS operator certificate. NAFI asserted that an applicant may be able to pass an initial knowledge test through rote memorization and retain little useful information or application after passing the knowledge test. According to NAFI, the present FAA test management systems do not allow for the robust, multi-version testing that is truly able to test to the application level of learning. Commenters argued that training should encompass various topics and forms such as scenarios, multi-rotor aircraft, educational contact time from a flight instructor, and simulations. Conversely, National Roofing Contractors Association, NBAA, Southern Company, Aerospace Industries Association, and Nez Perce Tribe argued that the FAA should not require a training course. Aviation Management suggested that the FAA make informational and training materials available online and also create online training programs, but should not require training courses. National Roofing Contractors Association, NRECA, and Team Rubicon suggested allowing industries to have tailored certification processes or training specific to their needs, or to allow agencies and organizations to conduct tailored in-house training. The FAA took a risk-based approach to defining the airman certification requirements for small UAS remote pilots, and in light of the contained nature of operations, opted not to propose specific training, flight experience, or demonstration of proficiency in order to be eligible for a certificate. A remote pilot certificate applicant’s knowledge of small UAS, as well as regulations concerning safe operations in the NAS, can adequately be evaluated through an initial and recurrent knowledge tests. A person who has acquired the pertinent knowledge will pass the knowledge tests while a person who has not done so will fail the test. In response to commenters’ concerns about rote memorization, the FAA notes that in addition to passing the initial knowledge test, remote pilot certificate holders will also have to pass a recurrent knowledge test every two years to ensure that they have retained the knowledge necessary to safely operate in the NAS. Further, remote pilot certificate holders will also be subject to continuing FAA oversight. The FAA emphasizes that under 49 U.S.C. 44709 and § 107.7(b), the FAA may reexamine a certificated remote pilot if it has sufficient reason to believe that the remote pilot may not be qualified to exercise the privileges of his or her certificate.137 Because the qualification framework for the remote pilot certificate is based on aeronautical knowledge, a reexamination under section 44709 and § 107.7(b) would be limited to the certificate holder’s aeronautical knowledge. The reexamination may be conducted using an oral or written knowledge test."

Second, as discussed in III.F.2.h below, the FAA will require that pilots with military experience operating unmanned aircraft pass an initial knowledge test in order to obtain a remote pilot certificate with small UAS rating, and pass a recurrent knowledge test every 24 months subsequent in order to continue to exercise the privileges of that certificate. Many commenters, including National Association of State Aviation Officials, NAAA, ALPA, and NAMIC, supported the FAA’s proposal to require an initial aeronautical knowledge test in order to operate a small UAS. Conversely, several commenters opposed the initial aeronautical knowledge test. Commenters argued that initial testing is ‘‘overkill’’ and the FAA should treat small UAS pilots like part 103 ultralight vehicle pilots and not require airman certification or testing. The commenters further argued that all testing is unnecessary and inappropriate. The FAA disagrees with the commenters who asked that the knowledge test be abolished. Title 49 U.S.C. 44703 requires the FAA to ensure that an airman certificate applicant is qualified and able to perform the duties related to the position to be authorized by the certificate. Here, in order to meet its statutory obligation to determine that an applicant for a remote pilot certificate possesses the knowledge necessary to safely operate in the NAS, the FAA is requiring that those persons pass an initial aeronautical knowledge test. Knowledge testing is the most flexible and efficient means for ensuring that a remote pilot possesses the requisite knowledge to operate in the NAS because it allows the applicant to acquire the pertinent knowledge in whatever manner works best for him or her. The applicant can then take and pass the aeronautical knowledge test to verify that he or she has indeed acquired the pertinent areas of knowledge. NAFI recommended that an applicant should be required to obtain an instructor endorsement to take the initial aeronautical knowledge test. SkyView Strategies suggested that to protect the public from a poorly prepared UAS operator who receives a passing grade but gets important questions wrong, the UAS operator should be required to present to a flight training instructor his or her written test results, noting areas where knowledge is lacking. The FAA disagrees with the recommendation that an applicant should be required to obtain an instructor endorsement to take the initial aeronautical knowledge test. While an instructor endorsement is generally required for part 61 pilot certificates, the significantly reduced risk associated with small UAS operations conducted under part 107 would make this framework unduly burdensome in this case. Instead, a stand-alone knowledge test is sufficient to verify the qualification of the remote pilot certificate applicant. Because the aeronautical knowledge test will determine whether an applicant possesses the knowledge needed to safely operate a small UAS, a separate flight instructor endorsement should not be required to take the knowledge test."

Like the flight review requirement specified in § 61.56, the recurrent knowledge test provides the opportunity for a remote pilot’s aeronautical knowledge to be reevaluated on a periodic basis. The FAA adopts this provision as proposed, with one change. As discussed in III.F.2.i, the FAA exempts part 61 pilot certificate holders from the requirement to complete recurrent knowledge tests as long as they satisfy the flight review requirements of § 61.56 and complete an online training course every 24 months. ALPA, AOPA, AUVSI and several other commenters supported the requirement for a recurrent knowledge test. Conversely, Colorado Cattlemen’s Association and a few individual commenters argued that a recurrent knowledge test is unnecessary. The Colorado Cattlemen’s Association explained that small UAS operations present a substantially reduced risk as compared to manned-aircraft operations. Therefore, the commenter argued, it is appropriate to impose different, and in some instances lesser, operational requirements. The FAA disagrees with the notion that no periodic reevaluation of knowledge is necessary. Knowledge of rules, regulations, and operating principles erodes over time, particularly if the remote pilot is not required to recall such information on a frequent basis. This is a fundamental principle of airman certification, and it applies to all FAA-certificated airmen. For part 61 pilot certificate holders, the flight review, conducted under § 61.56, specifically requires ‘‘[a] review of the current general operating and flight rules of part 91’’ in addition to maneuvers necessary to safely exercise the privileges of the certificate. Likewise, the FAA considers a recurrent knowledge test to be an effective means of evaluating a remote pilot’s retention of knowledge necessary to safely operate small unmanned aircraft in the NAS. Because of the reduced risk posed by small UAS, the FAA is not requiring remote pilots to demonstrate a minimum level of flight proficiency to a specific standard or recency of flight experience in order to exercise the privileges of their airman certificate. Drone Labs suggested extending the time period between recurrent tests to 5 years, and/or making the test available online to ease recertification. Kansas Farm Bureau recommended a 6-year interval between recurrent tests, similar to the interval for renewal of a driver’s license. The FAA does not agree that the recurrent testing interval should be longer than two years. Unlike the privileges afforded by a driver’s license, which are exercised on a frequent basis by most drivers, many holders of remote pilot certificates may only exercise their privileges occasionally or may not regularly conduct operations that apply all of the concepts tested on the aeronautical knowledge test. For example, a remote pilot in command may spend years never operating outside of Class G airspace, and then may move to a different location that requires him or her to begin conducting small UAS operations in Class D airspace. Based on experience with manned pilots, those persons who exercise the privileges of their certificate on an infrequent basis are likely to retain the knowledge for a shorter period of time than those who exercise the privileges of their certificate on a regular basis."

NBAA, Small UAV Coalition and Texas A&M University agreed with the proposed rule requiring only a recurrent knowledge test in lieu of the initial knowledge test to qualify for a UAS operator airman certificate. Prioria said that military UAS operators and OEM\u0002certified UAS operators should be grandfathered in without the need to take an initial knowledge test because their prior operational experience should suffice. In addition, Aviation Model Code of Conduct Initiative, Boeing Commercial Airplanes, Small UAV Coalition, and others supported accepting existing pilot credentials, especially military pilot credentials, in lieu of requiring those pilots to take an initial knowledge test or obtain a separate small UAS certificate. ArgenTech Solutions suggested that FAA should put a time limit on when military experience is acceptable for taking the recurrent knowledge test. In contrast, ALPA and others suggested that an initial knowledge test, rather than just a recurrent test, is appropriate for applicants with military experience flying UAS. ALPA noted that such pilots do not necessarily have experience operating in the NAS, and therefore cannot be assumed to be familiar with all the subject areas included in the initial test. ALPA also pointed to the wide variety of UAS used in the military and suggested that a given pilot’s experience may not necessarily be relevant to the operation of a small UAS in the NAS. ALPA also stated that the FAA should review a military pilot’s specific training, skills, and experience before determining what ‘‘supplemental training, knowledge testing, or skills demonstration’’ might be needed. Similarly, one commenter asserted that experience operating military UAS is not relevant to the operation of a civil small UAS, and that therefore those with military experience should be subject to the same testing requirements as other applicants. Another individual echoed ALPA’s concern that military operations are conducted almost exclusively in military airspace, not in the NAS. One commenter, while supporting an initial-test exemption for applicants with military experience, added that former military UAS pilots do not necessarily understand civil operations in the NAS. Planehook Aviation, NOAA, DOD, and an individual commenter said that the prior military experience provision proposed in § 107.75 should apply to both military and non-military COA UAS operators. One commenter provided supporting reasoning stating that ‘‘[t]here are several non-military Federal agencies that have well established sUAS programs and, as is the case with NASA, they have decades of experience with sUAS and operating sUAS in the NAS.’’ NOAA argued that there are no practical differences between NOAA pilots and military pilots because they are both trained in the same facilities. DOD raised a similar argument, asking that the rule recognize DOD civilian and contractor personnel that have a level of training equivalent to military personnel. One individual suggested that the FAA allow civilian operators with a minimum of 1,000 logged hours as operators of UAS for government and military agencies to qualify for taking the recurrent knowledge test instead of the initial test."

    "text":"For the reasons discussed below, this rule will allow part 61 pilot certificate holders (other than the holders of a student pilot certificate) with current flight reviews 139 to substitute an online training course for the aeronautical knowledge testing required by this rule. Airborne Law Enforcement Association and Texas A&M University\u0002Corpus Christi, suggested requiring only the recurrent knowledge test for part-61- certificated pilots. Numerous commenters also suggested that holders of part 61 airman certificates should be required to take only the recurrent knowledge test, not the initial knowledge test, or should be exempted entirely from knowledge-testing requirements. One commenter suggested that the holders of private, commercial, and ATP certificates who have operated UAS under exemptions be exempted from the initial knowledge test requirement. Another commented that non-military COA pilots should be permitted to take just the recurrent test, since the applicants will usually hold at least a private pilot certificate. One commenter stated that those applicants who hold part 61 pilot certificates should be required only to complete UAS-specific modules as part of the existing FAA Wings program. Another commenter stated that there should be a provision to enable existing small UAS pilots with a certain amount oflogged PIC time to fly a small UAS without having to take a knowledge test. The FAA agrees with commenters who suggested that requiring part-61- certificated pilots who satisfy the flight\u0002review requirements of § 61.56 to take an initial or recurrent knowledge test is unduly burdensome. Through initial certification and subsequent flight reviews, a part-61-certificated airman is required to demonstrate knowledge of many of the topic areas tested on the UAS knowledge test. These areas include: Airspace classification and operating requirements, aviation weather sources, radio communication procedures, physiological effects of drugs and alcohol, aeronautical decision-making and judgment, and airport operations. Because a part 61 pilot certificate holder is evaluated on these areas of knowledge in the course of the part 61 certification and flight review process, reevaluating these areas of knowledge on the initial and recurrent knowledge tests conducted under part 107 would be needlessly duplicative. However, there are UAS-specific areas of knowledge (discussed in section III.F.2.j of this preamble) that a part-61- certificated pilot may not be familiar with. Accordingly, instead of requiring part-61-certificated pilots who are current on their flight reviews to take the initial and recurrent knowledge tests, this rule will provide those pilots with the option to take an online training course focusing on UAS\u0002specific areas of knowledge. Just as there is an initial and recurrent knowledge test, there will also be an initial and recurrent training course available to part 61 pilot certificate holders. Those certificate holders will be able to substitute the initial training course for the initial knowledge test and the recurrent training course for the recurrent knowledge test. To ensure that a certificate holder’s UAS-specific knowledge does not become stale, this rule will include the requirement that a part 61 pilot certificate holder must pass either the recurrent training course or the recurrent knowledge test every 24 months.

    "text":"The NPRM also proposed testing (on both the initial and recurrent knowledge tests) knowledge of airspace classification and operating requirements, as well as knowledge of flight restrictions affecting small unmanned aircraft operation. The NPRM explained that part 107 would include airspace operating requirements, such as the requirement to obtain ATC permission prior to operating in controlled airspace, and in order to comply with those requirements, an airman would need to know how to determine the classification of the airspace in which he or she would like to operate. The NPRM also proposed to test knowledge of how to determine which areas of airspace are prohibited, restricted, or subject to a TFR. Under the NPRM, this area of knowledge would also be included in the recurrent knowledge test because: (1) Airspace that the airman is familiar with could become reclassified over time; (2) the location of existing flight restrictions could change over time; and (3) some airmen may not regularly encounter these issues in their operations. For the reasons discussed below, this rule will include knowledge of airspace classification and operating requirements and knowledge of flight restrictions affecting small unmanned aircraft operation as an area of knowledge tested on both the initial and recurrent knowledge tests. The California Agricultural Aircraft Association supported testing on how the airspace is managed, what the rules and regulations are, and how manned aircraft operate in the airspace. Aerius suggested that the knowledge test should include special use airspace, right-of-way rules, visual scanning, aeromedical factors (e.g., the limitations of the human eye), and accident reporting. On the other hand, the Electronic Frontier Foundation asserted that airspace classification is not relevant for low altitude micro UAS flights far away from airports and should not be tested for airmen seeking to operate micro UAS. The FAA declines to eliminate airspace classification as an area of knowledge tested for small UAS operations. As an initial matter, the FAA notes that this rule will not prohibit any small UAS (including micro UAS) from operating near airports. For UAS not operating near an airport, the FAA notes that controlled airspace can extend a significant distance away from an airport. For example, the surface area of Class B airspace can extend up to 8 nautical miles away from an airport. Additionally, airspace classification may change over time; uncontrolled (Class G) airspace may be changed to controlled airspace and vice versa. A remote pilot of any small UAS will need to have the ability to determine what class of airspace his or her small UAS operation will take place in to ensure that the operation complies with the airspace rules of part 107. In response to Aerius, the FAA notes that special-use airspace will be covered under knowledge of flight restrictions, which will determine the test taker’s knowledge of regulatory restrictions on small UAS flight imposed through means such as prohibited airspace or a TFR. Right-of-way rules, visual scanning, and accident reporting will be covered by the knowledge area of regulations applicable to small UAS operations because all of these concepts are codified in the operational regulations of part 107.

    "text":"The NPRM proposed to test, on the initial and recurrent knowledge test, knowledge of official sources of weather. The NPRM also proposed to test on the initial knowledge test whether the applicant understands the effects of weather and micrometeorology (weather on a localized and small scale) on a small unmanned aircraft operation. The NPRM explained that knowledge of weather is necessary for the safe operation of a small unmanned aircraft because, due to the light weight of the small unmanned aircraft, weather could have a significant impact on the flight of the aircraft. One commenter recommended the removal of ‘‘official’’ from ‘‘official weather sources,’’ saying that operation of a UAS calls for assessment of ‘‘local’’ weather conditions, and, furthermore, that there are no clearly identified ‘‘official sources of weather.’’ Aviation Management suggested that official sources of weather be excluded from the recurrent knowledge test. The FAA agrees with the commenter that there are no specific ‘‘official sources of weather,’’ and has removed that terminology from this rule. However, the FAA emphasizes that there are several sources of aviation weather useful to remote pilots. Accordingly, remote pilots will be required to be familiar with aviation weather products such as the ones provided by the National Weather Service through Flight Service Stations, Direct User Access Terminal Systems (DUATS), and/or Flight Information Services-Broadcast (FIS–B).140 While this rule does not require the use of those sources of weather for planning flights, aviation weather sources could be a valuable resource for remote pilots that choose to use them. For example, a remote pilot conducting an operation in an area with quickly changing weather may wish to access weather information from an aviation weather source for the most up-to-date weather data to ensure that the small UAS operation will comply with the minimum visibility and cloud clearance requirements of § 107.51. The FAA notes that aviation weather sources include weather data that can be used to evaluate local weather conditions.141 Because there is no requirement for remote pilots to use aviation weather products on an ongoing basis, the FAA has removed this area of knowledge from the recurrent aeronautical knowledge test. Accordingly, this rule will include knowledge of aviation weather sources and the effects of weather on small unmanned aircraft performance on the initial knowledge test. Additionally, this rule will include knowledge of the effects of weather on small unmanned aircraft performance as an area of knowledge on the initial training course available to part 61 pilot certificate holders because this is a UAS-specific area of knowledge that is not included in the training and testing required for a part 61 pilot certificate.

    "text":"The NPRM proposed to include crew resource management as an area of knowledge to be tested on the initial and recurrent knowledge tests to ensure that an applicant for a remote pilot certificate knows how to function in a team environment, such as when visual observers are used to assist a remote pilot. In those circumstances, the remote pilot would be in charge of those observers and therefore need an understanding of crew resource management. Several commenters, including the Small UAV Coalition, Princeton University, and the Electronic Frontier Foundation, argued that crew resource management may not be relevant for all small UAS operations and, as such, should be removed from the knowledge test. Princeton University added that crew resource management would be an irrelevant area of knowledge for student operators who will be operating the aircraft at a low altitude, for a limited distance, on university property, and under the direct supervision of a faculty member. Electronic Frontier Foundation stated that this area of knowledge is irrelevant for micro UAS operations. One commenter suggested removal of crew resource management stating it is ‘‘overkill’’ and is really just referring to possible communications between the pilot and the visual observer. If kept, the commenter suggested modifying it to ‘‘Crew resource management as it may pertain to operation of a small unmanned aircraft system.’’ The FAA acknowledges that not all small UAS operations will utilize a visual observer or more than one manipulator of the controls of the small unmanned aircraft. However, the FAA anticipates that many remote pilots operating under part 107 will likely use a visual observer or oversee other individuals that may manipulate the controls of the small unmanned aircraft. In order to allow flexibility for certificated remote pilots to determine whether or not to use a visual observer or oversee other individuals manipulating the controls of the small unmanned aircraft, the FAA must ensure that an applicant for a remote pilot certificate is able to function in a team environment and maximize team performance. This includes situational awareness, proper allocation of tasks to individuals, avoidance of work overloads in self and in others, and effectively communicating with other members of the crew such as visual observers and individuals manipulating the controls of a small UAS. The scenario Princeton University provided in its comment is precisely the type of scenario that would require a certificated remote pilot in command to have an understanding of crew resource management. The remote pilot in command in Princeton University’s scenario would be supervising a student who is manipulating the controls of the small unmanned aircraft. Therefore, the remote pilot in command in that scenario would need to know how to effectively communicate and guide his or her crew (the student). In response to Electronic Frontier Foundation, the FAA notes that even remote pilots operating smaller UAS may choose to use a visual observer or supervise other manipulators of the controls. It is not necessary to change the title of this area of knowledge because crew resource management correctly captures what this area of knowledge will cover. The FAA also notes that this rule will include crew resource management as an area of knowledge on the initial and recurrent training courses available to part 61 pilot certificate holders because this is a UAS-specific area of knowledge.

    "text":"Finally, the NPRM proposed to include radio communication procedures as an area of knowledge covered on the initial aeronautical knowledge test. Several commenters, including Princeton University, Predesa, and Aviation Management, argued that radio communications may not be relevant for all small UAS operations and as such, should be removed from the knowledge test. Predesa suggested that the FAA design a new ‘‘Class G-only unmanned aircraft operator certificate with a small UAS rating’’ that, among other things, does not include radio communication procedures as an area of knowledge that is tested on the knowledge test. One commenter recommended removal of ‘‘radio communication procedures’’ because there is no requirement for radio communications of any sort with small UAS operations. As discussed earlier, the FAA expects that a number of small UAS operationswill take place near an airport. That is why § 107.43 prohibits a small unmanned aircraft from interfering with airport operations or traffic patterns. Understanding radio communication procedures will assist a remote pilot in command operating near a Class G airport in complying with this requirement. Understanding radio communication procedures will assist a remote pilot in command operating near a Class G airport in complying with this requirement if that pilot chooses to use a radio to aid in his or her situational awareness of manned aircraft operating nearby. As described in section 4–1–9 of the Aeronautical Information Manual, manned-aircraft pilots may broadcast their position or intended flight activity or ground operation on the designated Common Traffic Advisory Frequency (CTAF). This procedure is used primarily at airports that do not have an airport traffic control tower, or have a control tower that is not in operation. Pilots of radio-equipped aircraft use standard phraseology to announce their identification, location, altitude, and intended course of action. Self\u0002announcing for arriving aircraft generally begins within 10 nautical miles of the airport and continues until the aircraft is clear of runways and taxiways. Aircraft on the ground intending to depart will begin to make position reports prior to entry of the runway or taxiway and continue until departing the traffic pattern. Aircraft remaining in the pattern make position reports on each leg of the traffic pattern. Thus, knowledge of radio communication procedures will provide a remote pilot in command with the ability to utilize a valuable resource, CTAF, to help determine the position of nearby manned aircraft. As such, this rule will retain this area of knowledge on the initial aeronautical knowledge test."

For the reasons discussed below, the FAA will add a section on maintenance and inspection to the initial and recurrent knowledge tests and the online training courses. The FAA will not add any other areas of knowledge to the knowledge tests or training courses. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) suggested that the test content should include awareness of lost-link failsafe procedures, operator development, use of maintenance and inspection steps and guides, and the characteristics and proper handling of lithium batteries. The NTSB referred to an April 2006 accident involving a U.S. Customs and Border Protection unmanned aircraft and encouraged the FAA to review its recommendations and supporting information stemming from that accident for potential lessons learned when developing guidance material and specific content for the written knowledge tests outlined in proposed part 107. The FAA notes that topics associated with lost-link failsafe procedures will be covered by the area of knowledge testing an applicant’s understanding of the applicable small UAS regulations. With regard to maintenance and inspection, the FAA has taken action by adding maintenance and inspection knowledge test topic area requirements to the initial and recurrent knowledge tests. The addition of maintenance and inspection knowledge test topics will consist of small UAS basic maintenance and inspection knowledge that is common to all small UAS regardless of complexity. An understanding of maintenance and inspection issues will ensure that remote pilots are familiar with how to identify when a small unmanned aircraft is not safe to operate, and how to maintain a small unmanned aircraft to mitigate the possibility of aircraft failure during flight. Although this area of knowledge will not cover every possible inspection and maintenance method, it will provide a baseline of knowledge that will be useful to all small UAS remote pilots. The FAA disagrees with NTSB’s recommendation that the knowledge test include a topic on the characteristics and proper handling of lithium batteries. Under § 107.36, small UAS are prohibited from carriage of hazardous materials. When installed in the aircraft for use as a power source (as opposed to carriage of spares or cargo), lithium batteries are not considered hazardous material.142 NOAA suggested that the knowledge test include questions relating to protecting and operating in the context of wildlife. The Ventura Audubon Society also suggested that the FAA test an applicant’s understanding of Federal and State wildlife protection laws. The FAA is required by statute to issue an airman certificate to an individual when the Administrator finds that the individual is qualified and physically able to safely perform the duties authorized by the certificate. See 49 U.S.C. 44703(a) (stating that the Administrator ‘‘shall issue’’ an airman certificate to an individual who is qualified and physically capable). Therefore, the FAA cannot deny or delay the issuance of an airman certificate if an applicant has demonstrated that he or she is qualified and physically able to safely perform the duties authorized by the certificate.

Holders of a part 61 pilot certificate who elect to take the online training course instead of the aeronautical knowledge test will, as proposed in the NPRM, be required to submit their certificate to a FSDO, DPE, ACR, or CFI in order to verify their identity. Part 61 pilot certificate holders will be issued a temporary remote pilot certificate immediately upon acceptance of their certificate application while all other applicants will be issued a temporary remote pilot certificate upon successful completion of TSA security vetting. Many commenters, including Google, NAMIC, and Edison Electric Institute, agreed that applicants for a remote pilot certificate with a small UAS rating should be vetted by TSA as a prerequisite for obtaining a certificate. The City and County of Denver noted that a specific vetting mechanism is not detailed in the proposed regulations, and recommended that the FAA expressly require a completed Security and Threat Assessment (STA) as a prerequisite for obtaining an operating license. Virginia Commonwealth University Honors Students recommended that the vetting process include a criminal background check and that FAA decline operators who have been charged with a violent or sexual crime. The American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers and the IME suggested that the FAA state explicitly in the final rule that failing the security threat assessment will disqualify an individual from obtaining an unmanned aircraft operator certificate with a small UAS rating. These and other commenters also generally noted that the FAA should ensure that there is a redress procedure for cases where an individual believes he or she improperly failed the security threat assessment. IME recommended that the certificate action processes codified in 49 U.S.C. 46111, including revocations, hearings, timely appeals and reviews, be included in the final rule. "

    "text":"Regarding issuance and positive identification, many commenters suggested changes to the FAA’s current process and responsibilities for testing, acceptance of airman applications, and issuance of airman certificates that would only apply to unmanned aircraft operator certificates with a small UAS rating. AirGon, as well as another individual commenter, generally suggested that the knowledge testing centers process the applications, verify the identity of the applicant and submit the applications to TSA. As discussed in section III.F.2.k.iii above, knowledge testing centers will be required to positively verify the identity of the applicant prior to providing him or her with a knowledge test to ensure that someone else is not taking the test for the applicant. The NPRM proposed that an applicant who passes a knowledge test would then have to be positively identified a second time by a FSDO, DPE, ACR, or CFI. This second identification would impose a burden in the form of travel costs and service fees (charged by DPEs, ACRs, and CFIs) without benefits sufficient to justify this burden, as the applicant has already been positively identified. Accordingly, this rule will not require applicants who pass an aeronautical knowledge test to submit their application to a FSDO, DPE, ACR, or CFI. Instead these applicants may submit their paper application via mail or electronically via IACRA. The FAA notes, however, that as discussed previously, part 61 pilot certificate holders who have completed a flight review within the previous 24 months will have the option to take an online training course instead of an aeronautical knowledge test. Because part 61 pilot certificate holders who elect to exercise this option will not be positively identified at a knowledge testing center, this rule will require them to submit their remote pilot application to a FSDO, DPE, ACR, or CFI so that the person accepting their application can positively verify the identity of the applicant and establish that the applicant has met the eligibility requirements of the remote pilot certificate with small UAS rating. Under this approach, FSDOs, DPEs, and ACRs, who can currently accept applications for an airman certificate, will continue doing so for part 61 pilot certificate holders who take the online training course instead of a knowledge test. Additionally, as proposed in the NPRM, CFIs will also be able to accept remote pilot certificate applications because CFIs are recognized by TSA regulations as being able to verify identity.144 The FAA notes that there is an approximate combined total of 100,000 DPEs, ACRs, and CFIs, all of whom will be able to accept an airman application and verify identity of part 61 pilot certificate holders under this rule. ALPA questioned the use of the term ‘‘student pilot’’ in the TSA vetting section of the NPRM. The FAA acknowledges the terminology should have been ‘‘applicant for remote pilot certificate with small UAS rating’’ and will correct the terminology in the final rule accordingly."

    "text":"Section 107.79 will allow the holder of a remote pilot certificate with a small UAS rating to voluntarily surrender it to the FAA for cancellation. However, the FAA emphasizes that cancelling the certificate pursuant to § 107.79 will mean that the certificate no longer exists, and the individual who surrendered the certificate will need to again go through the entire certification process if he or she subsequently changes his or her mind. For individuals who are not part 61 pilot certificate holders, this includes passing the initial aeronautical knowledge test. Accordingly, § 107.79(b) will require the individual surrendering the certificate to include the following signed statement (or an equivalent) in his or her cancellation request: I voluntarily surrender my remote pilot certificate with a small UAS rating for cancellation. This request is made for my own reasons with full knowledge that my certificate will not be reissued to me unless I again complete the requirements specified in § 107.61 and § 107.63. The FAA did not receive any adverse comments on this provision when it was proposed in the NPRM. e. Additional Comments on Remote Pilot Certificate Several commenters, including National Business Aviation Association, the State of Nevada, and Southern Company, agreed that unmanned aircraft operator certificates with a small UAS rating should not expire. On the other hand, two commenters suggested that the certificate should expire every 2 years, and that the FAA should require passing the recurrent knowledge test for renewal. The American Insurance Association said that employees of insurance companies who operate micro UAS should only have to be certificated once and there should be no annual two year renewal unless the insurance company elects to replace its selected micro UAS. NetMoby commented that an unmanned aircraft operator certificate with a small UAS rating should be automatically revoked if the remote pilot fails a recurrent aeronautical knowledge test. Other commenters suggested that there should be a process for the FAA to revoke an unmanned aircraft operator certificate with a small UAS rating if the operator operates a UAS in an unsafe manner. NetMoby also suggested that a remote pilot who violates the prohibition regarding UAS operation in certain airspace should have their unmanned aircraft operator certificate with a small UAS rating revoked for life. As with other pilot certificates issued by the FAA, a remote pilot certificate with a small UAS rating will never expire. However, under the provisions of this rule, after a person receives a remote pilot certificate with a small UAS rating, that person will have to demonstrate that they have retained the required aeronautical knowledge in order to retain the privileges to operate a small unmanned aircraft. As discussed in section III.F.2.g of this preamble, a remote pilot who does not hold a part 61 pilot certificate will have to pass a recurrent aeronautical knowledge test given by an FAA knowledge testing center every 24 calendar months after the issuance of a new remote pilot certificate with a small UAS rating to continue to exercise the privileges of that certificate in the NAS. A remote pilot who holds a part 61 pilot certificate will have to either maintain a current flight review and complete an online recurrent training course every 24 calendar months, or pass a recurrent aeronautical knowledge test as described above. This will ensure that a remote pilot continues to retain the knowledge necessary to safely operate a small unmanned aircraft."

The NPRM also proposed to prohibit a person from making any reproduction or alteration, for a fraudulent purpose, of any certificate, rating, authorization, record, or report that is made pursuant to part 107.

Three organizations and one individual commented on the proposal to prohibit fraud and false statements, and all of those commenters generally supported the proposal. For example, the Small UAV Coalition stated that they support the FAA’s proposal to prohibit intentionally false or fraudulent documents used to show compliance with part 107, and added that such false or fraudulent records or reports warrant enforcement action. One individual supported ‘‘heavy fines or jail’’ for those providing false information. Two commenters, the University of North Dakota’s John D.

Subpart C of 14 CFR part 13 specifies the penalties that the FAA may impose in response to a regulatory violation. To provide further clarity, the FAA has amended § 107.5 with a list of potential sanctions that could be imposed in response to a violation of § 107.5. Those sanctions may, among other things, include a civil penalty or certificate action. The FAA has also issued generally applicable guidance on sanctions that may be imposed for regulatory violations, which can be found in FAA Order 2150.3B.

    "text":"This section discusses two aspects of FAA oversight of part 107 small UAS operations. First, this section discusses inspection, testing, and demonstration of compliance requirements applicable to a part 107 operation. Second, this section discusses the accident-reporting requirements that part 107 will impose on the remote pilot in command. 1. Inspection, Testing, and Demonstration of Compliance The FAA’s oversight statutes, codified at 49 U.S.C. 44709 and 46104, provide the FAA with broad investigatory and inspection authority for matters within the FAA’s jurisdiction. Under section 46104, the FAA may subpoena witnesses and records, administer oaths, examine witnesses, and receive evidence at a place in the United States that the FAA designates. Under section 44709, the FAA may ‘‘reinspect at any time a civil aircraft, aircraft engine, propeller, appliance, design organization, production certificate holder, air navigation facility, or agency, or reexamine an airman holding a certificate issued [by the FAA].’’ The NPRM proposed to codify the FAA’s oversight authority in proposed § 107.7. First, § 107.7 would require the airman, visual observer, or owner of a small UAS to, upon FAA request, allow the FAA to make any test or inspection of the small unmanned aircraft system, the airman, and, if applicable, the visual observer to determine compliance with the provisions of proposed part 107. Second, § 107.7 would require an airman or owner of a small UAS to, upon FAA request, make available to the FAA any document, record, or report required to be kept by the applicable FAA regulations. For the reasons discussed below, this rule will finalize these provisions as proposed.151 The Department of Defense Policy Board on Federal Aviation suggested that § 107.7(a) be reworded to limit its applicability to ‘‘civil operators,’’ not operators in general. The commenter asserted that this change would preserve public operators’ statutory authorities. As discussed in section III.C.3 of this preamble, the applicability of part 107 is limited to civil aircraft. Thus, part 107 will not apply to public aircraft operations. Because public aircraft operations will not be subject to § 107.7 (or any other provision of part 107) there is no need to amend the regulatory text of § 107.7 with regard to civil aircraft. The Kansas State University UAS Program asked the FAA to clarify, with respect to § 107.7(b), what types of tests or inspections could be performed on the remote pilot or visual observer. Specifically, the commenter suggested that the FAA define whether such persons could be subjected to blood alcohol tests, drug tests, or knowledge tests. They also recommend that the section be reworded to reference § 91.17(c). Section 107.7(b) codifies the FAA’s authority under 49 U.S.C. 44709 and 46104, which allow the FAA to inspect and investigate the remote pilot. This may involve a review, reinspection, or requalification of the remote pilot. With regard to requalification, 49 U.S.C. "

Category 1 Operations Category 1 operations over people are permitted using a small unmanned aircraft that: (a) Weighs 0.55 pounds or less, including everything that is on board or otherwise attached to the aircraft at the time of takeoff and throughout the duration of each operation; and (b) does not contain any exposed rotating parts that would lacerate 3 human skin on impact with a human being. Remote pilots are responsible for determining that their small unmanned aircraft does not exceed the weight threshold and ensuring that their small unmanned aircraft does not contain any exposed rotating parts that would lacerate human skin. Furthermore, no remote pilot in command may operate a small unmanned aircraft as a Category 1 operation in sustained flight over open air assemblies unless the operation meets the applicable remote identification requirements.

Category 2 Operations Category 2 provides performance based eligibility and operating requirements when conducting operations over people using unmanned aircraft that weigh more than 0.55 pounds but do not have an airworthiness certificate under part 21. To be eligible for Category 2 operations, a small unmanned aircraft must comply with the following three safety requirements.4 First, the small unmanned aircraft must be designed, produced, or modified such that it will not cause injury to a human being that is equivalent to or greater than the severity of injury caused by a transfer of 11 foot-pounds (ft-lbs) of kinetic energy upon impact from a rigid object. A small unmanned aircraft will only be eligible to conduct Category 2 operations if the person submitting the declaration of compliance (the applicant) can demonstrate that the injury resulting from an impact between the small unmanned aircraft and a person on the ground is less than this injury severity limit. Second, the small unmanned aircraft must not contain any exposed rotating parts that would lacerate human skin on impact with a human being. Third, the small unmanned aircraft must not contain any safety defects. As a point of clarification, this rule uses the term ‘‘applicant’’ to refer to the person 5 who submits a declaration of compliance to the FAA for review and acceptance. An applicant for a declaration of compliance may be anyone who designs, produces, or modifies a small unmanned aircraft.6 Furthermore, a small unmanned aircraft eligible to conduct Category 2 operations must: (1) Display a label on the aircraft indicating eligibility to conduct Category 2 operations; (2) have current remote pilot operating instructions that apply to the operation of the small unmanned aircraft; and (3) be subject to a product support and notification process. The eligibility requirements for Category 2 are discussed in Section VI.A. of this preamble. This rule also sets forth certain operating requirements for remote pilots who conduct Category 2 operations. Specifically, a remote pilot must use a small unmanned aircraft that is: (1) Eligible for Category 2 operations; (2) listed on an FAA-accepted declaration of compliance as eligible for Category 2 operations; and (3) labeled as eligible to conduct Category 2 operations. Additionally, no remote pilot in command may operate a small unmanned aircraft as a Category 2 operation in sustained flight over open air assemblies unless the operation meets the remote identification operational and broadcast requirements for standard remote identification unmanned aircraft or unmanned aircraft with remote identification broadcast modules even prior to the operational compliance date for remote identification. The operating requirements for Category 2 are discussed in Section VI.E. of this preamble."
