# Extraction-of-Imperatives-aka-Policies-using-NLP
• Built an NLP model to extract Imperatives(Policies as per use case scenario) from a given text.
• Hugging Face Transformers were used to build a summarisation model based on the use case of extracting
imperatives by training model on custom dataset consisting of text and its corresponding imperatives.
• The current model was built by choosing a Pre Tarined model which best fits our use case, and training it with our
custom datase
NLP model to extract the Imperatives(Policies) from a Given Text.
Project still under development.
Will be uploaded soon.
